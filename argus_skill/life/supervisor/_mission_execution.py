"""One claimed mission: execute, meter, settle, and persist its outcome.

``_run_one`` is the orchestrator for one backlog item's full lifecycle. Its
phases live in two sibling mixins so no single module grows unwieldy:

- ``_mission_execution_runtime.py``: claim/context setup, runner invocation
  (incl. the restricted validator-repair capability claim), basic outcome
  derivation, and the budget/provider pause short-circuit.
- ``_mission_execution_settlement.py``: repair-capability settlement, the
  dynamic-plan stage guard, final status resolution against the backlog, and
  the journal event + return-dict emission.
