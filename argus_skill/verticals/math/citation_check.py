"""Two layers of citation checking, run out of band and blocking at delivery.

A proof that leans on Theorem 3.2 of some paper has imported a risk no compiler
sees and no reviewer of the proof itself will catch: the paper may not exist,
or it may exist and contain no Theorem 3.2, or contain one that says something
else. The principles document names this as the failure that survives every
retrieval harness, and it is the reason ``ExternalAssumption`` carries a
``source_id`` and a ``locator`` at all — without them there is nothing a checker
could be sent to look at.

**Two layers, because they fail differently.**

*Existence* is mechanical and this module does it: a registry is asked whether
the document resolves, and the answer is archived. It is cheap, it needs no
model, and it catches the fabricated identifier — the single most common way a
generated citation is wrong. What it cannot do is confirm anything. A DOI that
resolves says a paper is there; the citation was never about the paper, it was
about a proposition inside it. So this layer's only decisive answer is
``refutes``, and a successful resolution is recorded as ``inconclusive``: the
checker ran, and the question it was asked is not the question it can settle.
Anything else would let "the paper exists" quietly clear a gate that is asking
"and does it say this".

*Attribution* is the question that matters and it ends in somebody reading. The
reader supplies the passage they read; it is archived; their verdict is recorded
against it. Nothing here can verify that the passage is genuine — that is not a
gap this design can close, and pretending otherwise would be the dishonesty the
tier system exists to prevent. What it does close is the unexaminable verdict:
a confirmation now points at the text it was reached from, so the next reader
can disagree with it, which is exactly what ``ARTIFACT_REQUIRED_TIERS`` asks of
this tier.

**Asynchronous by construction, blocking only at delivery.** There is no queue
file and no daemon. ``status`` derives what is outstanding from the state
itself, so a checker can be started at any time, by any worker, in any order,
and nothing it does interrupts the reasoning in progress — a check that lands
while ``solve`` is running changes a status and stops no one. The block is at
the end, in ``stages.stage_completion_issues`` for the ``review`` stage only:
nothing ships until every citation is either confirmed against an archived
passage or honestly marked as citing prose.

**Several workers at once, and no lock.** Retrieved material is archived under
``research/literature/`` at a path derived from its own content, so two workers
who retrieve the same passage write identical bytes to one path and two who
retrieve different passages write to different ones. There is no shared mutable
ledger of literature to serialize on, which is why the concurrency problem this
would otherwise have does not arise. The state file is still shared and mutable,
and the write into it still goes through ``locked_state``.
