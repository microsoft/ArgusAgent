"""Manuscript-package contract gate (review stage) — ADVISORY, repair-loop-backed.

Root-cause fix for the Case B lifecycle stall: the deterministic manuscript
delivery contract (`verify_all_deliverables`, i.e. `manuscript check --layer all`)
was historically only ever *run* at the terminal ``manuscript`` stage. But the
paper package is produced and judged at the ``review`` stage, so when it did not
satisfy the contract the agent never received the concrete failure list — the
reviewer only gave vague prose, the engineer-runner semantic-stall detector
bailed the mission ``no_progress``, and it never reached the manuscript stage
where the repair loop lives.

This gate closes that gap. Once a paper package exists (MANUSCRIPT.md or
MANUSCRIPT.tex present), it runs the SAME deterministic checker at ``review`` and
writes the exact failure list through the shared ``research_gates`` repair
machinery, so the physics ``role_banner`` injects those failures + an executable
repair loop into the next agent round (via ``render_active_repair_blocks``). It is
strictly ADVISORY: it NEVER hard-blocks review->manuscript. Terminal completion
is judged by the L2 Reviewer against the ``manuscript`` stage checklist (there is
no separate machine hard gate); this review-stage check only gets the same
deterministic failure list in front of the agent earlier, before it reaches the
manuscript stage. When no paper package exists yet the gate passes (the paper is
a manuscript-stage deliverable; nothing to surface).

Failure ids: MPKG-000 (checker unavailable), MPKG-NNN (one per deterministic
`verify_all_deliverables` failure, verbatim).
