"""Regression test: a vertical must be able to satisfy its own completion gate.

``scope:final_submission`` is consumed by two independent gates, each keyed on
a different half of the vertical contract:

* ``_journal_has_final_certification`` reads ``completion_gate == "certified"``
* ``_research_project_done_issue`` reads a non-empty ``research_target_levels``

Both are cleared by exactly one artifact — the journal entry
``_mission_execution_settlement`` writes for a succeeded mission carrying
``item_scope == final_submission``. The enqueue-time downgrade was keyed on the
first gate alone, so any vertical declaring research targets *without* a
certified completion gate demanded a scope the enqueue boundary refused to
persist. A census of the shipped verticals found two in exactly that state:
``math`` and ``materials``. Neither could ever reach ``project_done``.

Observed live across testbed runs 8, 9 and 10 (``s-fed750c2``, ``s-1828745c``,
``s-b6efbc62``). With fixes #45 and #46 in place the Planner did emit
``TASK_SCOPE=final_submission``, and the item was still enqueued as::

    'Final-certify the universal m solution'
      tags = ['planner', 'scope:bounded', 'bounded_dag_node', 'stage:scope']
