"""fiction_writing revise adapter: consume a shared literary review -> plan.

The fiction end of the Review-Contract closed loop. The reviewer's structured
output (``fiction/review.json`` today) is parsed and validated by the SHARED
contract (:mod:`argus_skill.verticals.literary.shared.review_contract`) against
fiction's own
finding VOCABULARY, then turned into an ordered revision plan the revise stage
acts on — blocking continuity findings first, each carrying the
``must_not_break`` invariants the revision must not violate while fixing.

No new reviewer agent: the framework Reviewer role produces the review; this is
only the consumer that binds its findings to fiction's revise step.

#: Blocking continuity finding types (mirror the reviewer skill + the engine's
#: machine-decidable guarantees). A finding typed outside the fiction vocabulary
#: is rejected by the shared contract. ``temporal_consistency`` is arithmetic-
#: provable over story_state (age == current_year − birth_year; no birth in the
#: future; timeline order vs year) — see :mod:`.temporal`. ``verbatim_copy`` is
#: likewise machine-provable (a long shared verbatim run is a fact, not a taste),
#: the '不能抄' hard line — see :mod:`.novelty`.

#: Non-blocking craft / AI-tell finding types (heuristic observations). NOTE:
#: ``voice`` and ``ai_tell`` MAY carry ``blocking=True`` when the deterministic
#: style lint (:mod:`.style_lint`) trips an author-declared HARD contract — a
#: forbidden_lexicon term present or a declared ai_tell_budget exceeded. The
#: shared contract gates on the per-finding ``blocking`` flag, not on which set a
#: type belongs to, so this needs no separate vocabulary.
