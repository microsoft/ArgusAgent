"""Free helpers + mutable scratch state for one continuous-planner cycle.

``_PlanCycleState`` is threaded through the ``_plan_next_work`` lifecycle
phase mixins in ``_planning_cycle_intake.py``, ``_planning_cycle_verdict.py``,
``_planning_cycle_completion.py``, and ``_planning_cycle_enqueue.py``. It is
process-local scratch state for a single planning cycle call, never
persisted.

The free functions below operate on Reviewer-authored dynamic-plan revision
requests and the persisted research-target completion gate; they have no
``self`` dependency and are reused by more than one phase.
