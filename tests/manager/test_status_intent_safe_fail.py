"""Tests for the do-not-run / status-only triage safe-fail.

Incident (2026-07-11): a Chinese "请只做状态检查，不要运行任务" message was
dispatched to the team. Root cause was the empty-model pricing block making the
Manager's classify call raise; ``manager_triage`` then hit its
"triage failure -> treat as a task" fallback and enqueued the status request as
real work.

Defense-in-depth fix: on a triage FAILURE (the classify call errored), if the
operator explicitly forbade running (status-only / do-not-run), safe-fail to a
chat notice instead of dispatching. A SUCCESSFUL classify decision is never
overridden, so genuine work is never silently dropped (the codebase's
"never drop work to a bad classify" contract is preserved).
