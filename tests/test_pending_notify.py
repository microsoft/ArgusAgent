"""A paused mission has to reach the operator, not wait to be discovered.

A blocked verdict carrying an operator question parks the run and writes
`pending_question` to disk. The portal shows it — to whoever is watching the
portal. Nobody watches a long-running daemon, so the run sits there while the
operator assumes it is still working.

These tests pin two things: the question actually goes out, and nothing about
sending it can disturb the mission that just paused.
