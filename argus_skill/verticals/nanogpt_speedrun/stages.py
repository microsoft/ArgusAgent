"""NanoGPT Speedrun vertical — Recursive "First Steps" **Task 2**.

Objective: MINIMIZE the wall-clock TIME to train a NanoGPT (modded-nanogpt
lineage) down to a FIXED FineWeb validation loss of **3.28** on an **8×H100**
node. The score is SECONDS-TO-TARGET — lower is better. This is a TIME race,
NOT a BPB-minimization (that is the ``nanochat`` vertical) and NOT a kernel SOL
score (``kernelbench``).

Reference times to beat (Recursive, measured on Modal 8×H100):

    from an unoptimized start   ~186.5 s
    Recursive's best run         ~77.3 s   (faster than record #83 on the
                                            same hardware; PrimeIntellect
                                            leaderboard timing pending)

Same 4-stage setup→optimize→measure→report structure; the metric and the
reviewer's objective framing are TIME-to-target, not val_bpb.
