"""classical_poetry intake adapter: shared Task Envelope -> poetry brief.

The poetry end of the Task-Envelope loop — the SECOND vertical to consume the
shared contract, proving it generalizes beyond narrative. The derived brief is
PRIVATE to poetry (诗体/韵/句数 are prosody concepts fiction/prose would not share).

Two vertical-local semantic checks the shared schema cannot express:
* classical Chinese poetry is written in Chinese — a ``language`` other than
  ``zh`` is rejected loudly at intake;
* ``form`` must be a classical-poetry form (绝句/律诗/古体/词, or an english alias),
  not a narrative form — a mis-routed short_story fails here.
