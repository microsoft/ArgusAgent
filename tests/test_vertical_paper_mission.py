"""paper_mission must follow the VERTICAL, not a True default.

Regression: a kernel-grind objective ("research SOL-ExecBench, grind 2 kernels")
correctly routed to the kernelbench vertical, but paper_mission stayed True
(coarse default), so the supervisor picked the research run-stage pilot gate and
dumped a PILOT_OPERATOR_DECISION_TEMPLATE.json — a $0.55 blocked no-op. The fix
(apps/_runtime.py + loop.py) derives paper_mission from the vertical's completion
gate: only ``full_paper`` verticals are paper missions. This pins that invariant.
