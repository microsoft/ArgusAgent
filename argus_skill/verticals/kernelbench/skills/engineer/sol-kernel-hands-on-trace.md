name: "SOL Kernel Hands-on Trace"
description: "A concrete KernelBench/SOL process trace from optimizing 36_RMSNorm_ on B200, recorded as the measured causal chain we require — per iteration measured(ms, effective_BW, %peak, SOL) → bottleneck hypothesis → mechanism → re-measured → gap-to-SOL → next — with the roofline arithmetic shown, plus the real infra/correctness nails that interrupted the chain."

## Title
SOL Kernel Hands-on Trace

## Description
A **human-written seed exemplar** of how to optimize a KernelBench/SOL-style kernel
— a real, measured process trace to learn from and to keep evolving, not a polished
abstract playbook and not something harvested from a live run (the agent's own run
may take a wrong path; the seed is deliberately a known-good one). The trace's spine
is the reasoning we want the agent to internalize: a per-iteration **measured causal
chain**, where each step is bound to a real number and the next hypothesis follows
from the *gap to the roofline*, not from vibes. Infra and correctness failures are
recorded too, but as **interruptions to the chain**, not as the point of the trace.
Treat this as a starting exemplar: when a real kernel teaches you a sharper chain,
improve it.

## When to use
- The task is a correctness-gated GPU kernel benchmark with a frozen scorer.
- The agent must produce real speed/SOL numbers on B200/H100/A100 and record the
  measure → hypothesize → re-measure loop, including roofline arithmetic.
- The user asks for a trace, postmortem, or "what actually goes wrong when you try
  this yourself".
- A benchmark vertical task is stuck because the agent jumped to a mechanism
  without first measuring *which wall it is hitting*.

## When NOT to use
- You only need the high-level SOL workflow and artifact contract. Use
  `SOL Kernel SOTA Optimization`.
- The task is a paper benchmark matrix or model-training run rather than one
  kernel implementation.
- The scorer is unavailable and the user explicitly asks you not to attempt
  recovery.

## The one rule this trace exists to teach

> **The decisive insight is measured, not known.** You do not "know" a kernel is
> memory-bound; you measure its effective bandwidth against the roofline and read
> the bottleneck off the gap. Every link in the chain below carries a real number
> from the frozen scorer or from arithmetic on a real measured time. A link with
> an invented bandwidth is not a data point — it is fabrication, and it scores 0
> the same as a wrong kernel.
>
> **A second rule sits beside it: measure the bottleneck, but RETRIEVE the
> implementation.** You diagnose memory-vs-compute by measuring, never by recall — but
> the winning STRUCTURE's exact form (the MMA tile/operand layout, the SMEM swizzle, the
> TMA descriptor, the flash tiling) is architecture-specific knowledge your memory gets
> wrong, so go read the canonical reference (CUTLASS / the arch programming guide / a
> reference kernel) instead of re-deriving it. (Anti-cheat: general technique + arch docs
> only, never this task's answer kernel.) See `SOL Kernel SOTA Optimization` §0.

## What "process data" means here — the chain to learn

This exemplar records each optimization iteration as one linked block. Learn this
shape and produce it when it helps; it is a teaching exemplar, not a rigid form a
harness will grep for:

```text
ITER <n> — <what this candidate is>
  measured:    cand_ms=<frozen scorer's graded time>, SOL=<frozen scorer>
               effective_BW = <SOL-minimal bytes> / cand_ms = <X> TB/s = <P>% of <peak> TB/s
  read:        <one line — what the % tells you, e.g. "21% → ~5x redundant HBM traffic">
  bottleneck:  <hypothesis derived from the numbers: memory-bound / compute-bound /
                launch-overhead / occupancy / layout — and WHY the numbers say so>
  mechanism:   <the single concrete change this iteration makes, and why it attacks
                that bottleneck>
  re-measured: cand_ms=<frozen scorer's graded time>, SOL=<frozen scorer>; effective_BW=<X'> TB/s = <P'>% peak
  gap-to-SOL:  <opt_ms / SOL=1.0 floor> ; we are at <P'>% of peak, <delta> headroom below
  → next:      <the next hypothesis, chosen by where the remaining gap is>
```

**You compute the roofline yourself — the harness does not feed it to you:**

- **Bytes moved (SOL-minimal):** `numel × dtype_bytes × (reads + writes)`, taken from
  the kernel's **fixed shape/dtype API contract** (what the scorer feeds), not from
  input statistics/sparsity. For a read-once/write-once elementwise/normalization
  kernel that is `2 × numel × dtype_bytes`. Use the *minimal* traffic the operation
  requires; the gap between that and the achieved time is the redundant traffic you
  can remove.
- **Effective bandwidth:** `bytes_moved / cand_ms`, where `cand_ms` is the **frozen
  scorer's** time for the graded candidate — never a `gpu_run.py` debug time (it can
  diverge in precision/shape and fabricate a plausible-but-wrong bandwidth).
- **Peak bandwidth (the denominator):** measure it — do not trust the spec sheet.
  Run a trivial copy/saxpy kernel on the actual card via `gpu_run.py` and use the
  achieved HBM bandwidth. *Cross-check* against the scorer's SOL floor (see below) as
  confirmation only, never as the sole source — picking a slow kernel's `opt_ms`
  silently lowers the peak and inflates every later `%peak`.
- **SOL score:** comes from the **frozen scorer only**. `%peak-BW` is your own
  diagnostic for *how much headroom remains* — it never feeds the graded SOL, so its
  only job is to point you at the next bottleneck honestly. They move together but
  are different scales — never report one as the other.

## Real trace: KernelBench 36_RMSNorm_ on B200

Run in `/home/argustest/kb-hands-on-trace`, copied from the real
`kernelbench-mission-b200` scaffold. Target: `solutions/36_RMSNorm_.py`. Official
scoring: `./eval_solution.sh solutions` (frozen B200 eval server at
`http://127.0.0.1:2232`). Debug runs: `python gpu_run.py <script.py>`.

Reference op — RMSNorm along `dim=1` for shape `(112, 64, 512, 512)`, fp32:

```python
rms = torch.sqrt(torch.mean(x ** 2, dim=1, keepdim=True) + eps)
return x / rms
```

### The roofline, computed once up front

This is the arithmetic the agent must do before choosing a mechanism:

```text
numel        = 112 * 64 * 512 * 512 = 1.879e9 elements
dtype        = fp32 (4 bytes)               # the kernel loads `float`
SOL-minimal  = 2 * numel * 4 = 1.503e10 bytes = 15.03 GB   # read x once, write y once
```

Consistency check that pins the peak (do this — it is the turn-1 insight in action):

```text
scorer opt_ms (SOL=1.0 time) = 1.879 ms
15.03 GB / 1.879 ms = 8.00 TB/s
```

The scorer's SOL=1.0 time corresponds to **exactly 8.0 TB/s over the 2-pass byte
count** → the SOL target *is* the bandwidth roofline, ~8 TB/s is the right
denominator, and fp32 is confirmed (bf16 would have given a non-clean 4 TB/s).
RMSNorm is therefore a **memory-bound** kernel whose ceiling is "read x once,
write y once at full HBM bandwidth".

This closure happened to be exact; do not expect that. A cross-check landing within
~±5% of a copy-kernel-measured peak is normal (clock scaling, scorer quantization,
ECC) — defend the **measured** number, not a forced-clean one, and never nudge a
byte count or a peak to make the arithmetic close.

### The measured chain

```text
ITER 0 — baseline eager (`class ModelNew(Model): pass`)
  measured:    cand_ms=8.898, SOL=0.498
               effective_BW = 15.03 GB / 8.898 ms = 1.69 TB/s = 21% of 8.0 TB/s
  read:        21% of the roofline → ~5x the SOL-minimal bytes are being moved.
  bottleneck:  memory-bound, and eager pays it ~5 times: x**2, mean over dim=1,
               sqrt/rsqrt, divide each make a full-tensor HBM round-trip plus
               intermediates. The win is REMOVING redundant round-trips, not
               faster math.
  mechanism:   fuse all passes into one CUDA kernel — one thread owns one
               (batch, spatial) position, loops the 64 channels in registers,
               computes rsqrt(sum_sq/64 + eps), writes 64 normalized values.
               Read x once, write y once → approach the 8N-byte floor.
  re-measured: cand_ms=2.258, SOL=0.893
               effective_BW = 15.03 GB / 2.258 ms = 6.66 TB/s = 83% of 8.0 TB/s
  gap-to-SOL:  at 83% of peak; SOL floor opt_ms=1.879 ms (8.0 TB/s) is 0.38 ms /
               17% of peak BW away (headroom — we are below the roofline, not above)
  → next:      the remaining 17% is launch/occupancy or the 64-stride (uncoalesced)
               channel writes. Next hypothesis: warp-per-position cooperative
               reduction, or vectorized (float4) channel access for coalescing.
```

That single block — measured 21%, read "5x redundant", fuse, re-measured 83%, gap
17%, next hypothesis pointed at the remaining gap — **is** the process datum. The
old version of this trace recorded only ITER 0's `cand_ms` and ITER 1's final
`cand_ms`; the bandwidth column, the "why 21%", and the next-hypothesis-from-the-gap
were missing. Those are the parts that transfer to the next kernel; do not skip them.

### Implementation that realized ITER 1

```python
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline

class ModelNew(Model):
    def forward(self, x):
        return _get_rmsnorm_ext().rmsnorm_b200_forward(x, float(self.eps))
```

```c
const long base = b * 64L * spatial + s;
float vals[64];
float sum_sq = 0.0f;

#pragma unroll
for (int c = 0; c < 64; ++c) {
    const float v = x[base + (long)c * spatial];
    vals[c] = v;
    sum_sq += v * v;
}

const float inv_rms = rsqrtf(sum_sq * 0.015625f + eps);   // 1/64 = 0.015625

#pragma unroll
for (int c = 0; c < 64; ++c) {
    y[base + (long)c * spatial] = vals[c] * inv_rms;
}
```

Self-debug correctness on B200 before timing:

```text
shape (112, 64, 512, 512)
max_abs_err 8.344650268554688e-07
allclose_1e-2 True
```

Final official scorer:

```text
36_RMSNorm_ Y 2.258ms 3.90x SOL=0.893 tc_SOL=0.619 opt_ms=1.879 BEATS tc ✓
RESULT mean_SOL=0.6026 correct=8/8 beats_torch.compile=5/8
[scorer] NEW GLOBAL BEST mean_SOL=0.6026 (prev 0.5536)
```

## The nails that interrupted the chain

The chain above is the clean story. In the real run, four infra/correctness nails
came first — each one would have produced a *fake* chain link if not caught. Record
them too, because "the first failure is usually infrastructure, not algorithm."

- **Nail 1 — scorer bridge down.** `ERROR: B200 eval server unreachable at
  http://127.0.0.1:2232 ([Errno 111] Connection refused)`. Do not infer a score
  when the scorer is down — there is no measured link without it. Use
  `set -o pipefail` so a piped scorer failure cannot look successful. Recovery:
  `kubectl port-forward pod/argus-kbench-evalsrv 2232:9000 --address 127.0.0.1`
  then `curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:2232/health`.
- **Nail 2 — baseline file was not a valid candidate.** Scorer said
  `candidate defines no ModelNew`. `baseline/*.py` has `Model`; `solutions/*.py`
  must define `ModelNew`. A "score" that is really a no-ModelNew error is a
  fabricated link. Fix: `class ModelNew(Model): pass`.
- **Nail 3 — fresh sandbox missed `results/`.** Scorer printed a `RESULT` line then
  crashed appending history: `FileNotFoundError: 'results/sol_history.csv'`. A
  printed score with a non-zero exit is still a failed run. Record both the visible
  line and the exit code. Fix: `mkdir -p results`.
- **Nail 4 — wrong reduction axis + debug transport.** First code attempt used
  `dim=-1` (wrong) and tried to load the candidate file remotely, which failed:
  `gpu_run.py` sends only the script body to `/run` and does **not** sync local
  files. Embedded-source debug then exposed the math bug:
  `max_abs_err 0.827 ... allclose_1e-2 False`. A wrong-axis kernel can look
  plausible from code structure and is numerically invalid → SOL 0. Always print
  `max_abs_err` / `allclose` before any timing link goes into the chain.

## How to apply this chain to another benchmark kernel

1. Run the official scorer once with `set -o pipefail`. If infra fails, fix or
   report infra; do not optimize, and do not write a chain link without a real score.
2. Check the candidate API (`ModelNew`, unchanged `Model/get_inputs/get_init_inputs`)
   and create missing artifact dirs (`results/`, `attempts/`) before long runs.
3. Compute the roofline up front: SOL-minimal bytes, and a *defended* peak BW
   (measure it on the card or cross-check against the scorer's opt_ms floor).
4. Write one deliberately small correctness probe (`max_abs_err`, `allclose`)
   before timing.
5. For each iteration, record the full chain block: measured(ms, effective_BW,
   %peak, SOL) → read → bottleneck → mechanism → re-measured → gap-to-SOL → next.
6. Choose the next mechanism from **where the remaining gap is**, not from a menu
   of generic tricks. 21% of roofline → remove redundant traffic (fuse). 83% of
   roofline → chase coalescing/occupancy/launch. ~compute-bound → feed the tensor
   cores. **Then RETRIEVE that mechanism's canonical implementation** (the CUTLASS
   swizzle, the flash tiling, the arch's `wgmma`/`tcgen05` operand layout) rather
   than reciting it from memory — the layout your memory invents compiles and is
   silently slow or wrong.
7. Stop only when the gap to SOL is small or the next mechanism's expected gain is
   below noise — and say which it is.

## Response shape
- State the exact scorer command and whether it exited 0.
- Show the roofline arithmetic (SOL-minimal bytes, peak BW, how you defended peak).
- Quote every infra/correctness nail before any timing link.
- For each iteration, give the full measured chain block with real numbers.
- Quote the official per-kernel line and `RESULT` line for every re-measured link.
- End with the next hypothesis chosen by the remaining gap to SOL.
