"""Append-oriented search ledger for factor-mining trials.

Every backtest the agent runs — survivor *or* discard, success *or* failure —
is recorded here at the execution boundary (see :mod:`.backtest`). The ledger is
the raw evidence the L2 reviewer reads to judge **search breadth** and
**multiple-testing / cherry-picking risk**: a factor with IC 0.05 found after
one hypothesis is very different from the same IC found after 3,000 silent
trials.

Per the project's trust model this is **evidence, not a gate**. The ledger does
not decide pass/fail; the reviewer interprets it. It is therefore deliberately
dumb: it appends rows and never edits or judges them.

Tamper-evidence: rows are written as JSONL and chained by hash — each row
carries the hash of the previous row plus a hash of its own payload, so a
deleted or edited middle row breaks the chain and is detectable on
:func:`verify_chain`. This makes "I logged every trial" auditable without
needing immutable storage. It is lightweight tamper-*evidence*, not
tamper-*proofing*.
