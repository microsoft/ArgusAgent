"""fiction_writing anti-COPY / NOVELTY gate — the '不能抄' half of the corridor.

:mod:`.style_lint` asks "does this sound like a machine?"; this module asks "did
it copy the human?". The voice-card architecture is anti-plagiarism BY DESIGN
(abstract features + an explicit lexicon, never "imitate author X verbatim"), but
that principle had no teeth — nothing measured whether a *continuation* actually
lifted sentences from its source / canon. This IS that measurement, modelled 1:1
on :mod:`.style_lint` / :mod:`.temporal` so it plugs into the same deterministic
review gate.

Honesty contract (the same split style_lint uses):

* A long VERBATIM run shared between the draft and the reference text is a
  DETERMINISTIC FACT — the span literally appears in both — so a run at/over the
  block threshold is a BLOCKING ``verbatim_copy`` finding. Copying is categorically
  different from stylistic taste: there is a ground truth, so it earns real teeth.
* Comparison is punctuation- AND whitespace-insensitive (zh compares the stream of
  letters/ideographs/digits only), so swapping a comma for a period cannot split a
  verbatim run to evade the gate. en compares word tokens (punctuation already
  dropped).
* Comparison also NFKC-normalizes (full-width / compatibility variants fold to their
  canonical form) and, WHEN the optional ``opencc`` extra is installed, folds 繁→简
  (``t2s``) before comparing — so converting a lifted span between traditional and
  simplified script cannot evade the gate. WITHOUT ``opencc`` the 繁简 fold is
  skipped: a wholly script-converted lift is then NOT caught. This is an honest,
  documented gap (not a silent partial hand-table, which would make the green light
  lie); NFKC always applies regardless.
* Besides a single long run, the AGGREGATE verbatim-overlap ratio blocks when it
  exceeds a conservative model-seed default (guarded by an absolute floor so a
  short legitimate quotation in a tiny excerpt never trips it) — this catches
  lightly-edited 洗稿 that reorders/rebreaks copied text into medium runs.
* The THRESHOLDS (run length, overlap ratio) are MODEL-SEED, pending corpus
  calibration, and set conservatively HIGH so legitimate short quotation/allusion
  passes as a note. An author may TIGHTEN via ``novelty_budget``.
* Semantic / paraphrase plagiarism is NOT machine-reliable, so it earns NO teeth
  here — that stays reviewer guidance. We never fake a similarity score.

Absent a reference text (an original, not a continuation) nothing fires.
