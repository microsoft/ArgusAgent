"""Composition root for the user-facing Manager.

The Manager owns control-plane decisions around a mission: front-door routing,
vertical selection and persistence, stage transitions, and bounded
self-maintenance. Mission execution remains with LifeSupervisor, Planner,
Engineer, and Reviewer.

The implementation is split by concern across four sibling mixins. This module
contains only the public result dataclasses and the ``Manager`` shell that wires
shared state, usage accounting, and pipeline locking.
