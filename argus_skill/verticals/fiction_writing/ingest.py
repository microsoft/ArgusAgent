"""Corpus-ingestion SCAFFOLD for fiction_writing — the do-able, data-free half of
"step 4": the contract + plan skeleton the real ingestion plugs into. It does NOT
fetch, store, or fabricate anything (see ``references/corpus_ingestion_architecture.md``
for the full design). Like the calibration harness, it is honest about being
blocked without authorized sources rather than inventing cards.

The pipeline rides existing argus infrastructure — the source registry / rights
gate (:mod:`.sources`, :mod:`.source_check`) for authorization, and the
``learning`` vertical for distillation — and emits :data:`CRAFT_CARD_SCHEMA`
objects: ABSTRACT technique cards that carry evidence LOCATORS, never liftable
prose (the same anti-copy principle the voice cards / novelty gate enforce).
