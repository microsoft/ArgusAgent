"""The completion gate reads the claim ledger.

``proof_ledger`` derives ``closed_kernel`` and ``conditional_kernel``, and
until this wiring nothing consulted the answer: a stage could finish with a
ledger that contradicted itself. These tests pin the seam and, deliberately,
its limits — the gate blocks on *structural* defects and stays out of the
question of whether the mathematics is finished.
