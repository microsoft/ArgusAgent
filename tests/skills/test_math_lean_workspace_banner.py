"""Regression test: the math Engineer must be told the host's Mathlib exists.

``math-research-execution.md`` promises `import Mathlib` resolves
automatically. It does — through ``_resolve_lake_workspace``, whose first and
highest-priority step is "a lakefile above the source". An Engineer that
cannot see the host workspace does the obvious thing, writes its own lakefile
into the project root, and thereby *shadows* the built library with an empty
one. Observed live in run 7 (s-2962d053): 7.5 GB of Mathlib re-fetched into the
project while a built v4.34.0-rc1 workspace sat unread.
