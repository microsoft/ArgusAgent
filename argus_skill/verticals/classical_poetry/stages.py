"""classical_poetry-vertical stage definitions.

The SECOND real literary vertical. Its deliverable is a 近体诗 (or 古体/词) that
(1) passes the machine prosody check (押韵/平仄/粘对/孤平/三平尾 — reproducible),
(2) has a real conception/立意 (human/live judgement), and (3) reads un-AI (守禁忌).

It CONSUMES the same four shared contracts fiction does — Task Envelope, Review,
Artifact Manifest, Provenance — via ``checks.py``; its craft state (prosody/诗体/
韵) is vertical-PRIVATE (``prosody.py``) and never lifted into the shared layer.

Stages (``completion_gate="none"`` — reviewer verdict ends the mission):

1. **intake**: record ``poetry/task_envelope.json`` + derive ``poetry/poem_brief.json``.
2. **form_plan**: choose 体裁/韵部/起承转合 -> ``poetry/form_plan.json``.
3. **compose**: write the poem -> ``poetry/draft_poem.txt``.
4. **prosody_check**: run the machine validator -> ``poetry/prosody_report.json``;
   the STAGE_CHECK FAILS on any 出韵/失替/三平尾/孤平.
5. **review**: reviewer emits ``poetry/review.json`` (prosody blocking + craft
   non-blocking) per the shared review contract.
6. **revise**: apply fixes -> ``poetry/final_poem.txt`` + ``poetry/revision_plan.json``
   + ``poetry/artifact_manifest.json``.
