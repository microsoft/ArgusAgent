"""SkillLoop — agent-native Skill discovery plus supervised engineering.

This is the new code that argus-skill exists to deliver. It composes:

  * ``SkillStore``: path-only access to agent-readable Skill libraries.
  * ``SupervisedEngineer`` (new, with ``Reviewer`` vendored from ArgusBot):
    vertical round-loop that accepts decisive Engineer self-verification for
    bounded work or otherwise supervises until the Reviewer is satisfied.

Skill and wiki memory normally use independent review. For a bounded mission,
the Engineer may explicitly self-verify and waive Reviewer; if it also identifies
durable skill learning, the same Engineer thread is resumed once to author the
create or update semantic Skill documents directly in the project library.

End-to-end shape:

    task → Skill-library paths → engineer round-loop (engineer → reviewer)
            outcome → preserve Agent-authored semantic memory edits
            continue → inject next_action, next round
            blocked → stop with reason; direct memory edits remain persisted
