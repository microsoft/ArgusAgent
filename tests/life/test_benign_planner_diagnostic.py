"""A diagnostic that reports no failure must not become one in the agent's memory.

Observed on every run tonight
(/tmp/argus-night/home/projects/e8d2340c8962/events.jsonl event #10, and the
same at #10 of f9a27b1c16a7): the first planning cycle emitted

    life.planner.error — discarded stale planner verdict outbox after
    semantic state change

Nothing had failed. The Manager writing PIPELINE_STATE.json changes the project's
semantic state, so a verdict queued against the old state is correctly dropped.

But LIFE_PLANNER_ERROR is a journalled type, and the journal is what
`render_prelude` feeds back to the Planner as memory context. So every run wrote
a `planner_error` into the Planner's own history describing a failure that never
happened — the agent was reading an invented one each time it started.

The fix is a structural flag from the emitter, not a keyword match on the
message here: the emitter knows whether its own event was an error, and this
projection does not.
