"""A contract keyed on five enums must say what the five enums accept.

Testbed run 15 (``s-f0dbba19``) solved its problem — a reproducible survey, a
both-directions proof, and a Lean 4 file building against Mathlib with no
``sorry`` and no ``axiom`` — and then could not close at its final stage. The
Manager's completion was refused with ``missing_or_invalid_research_result``
against Reviewer messages that visibly contained a research result.

Six Reviewer rounds emitted a ``RESEARCH_RESULT`` block. The contract accepted
none of them::

    result_class=proof            correctness_status=proved
    novelty_status=unknown        significance_status=bounded_complete
    statement_fidelity_status=supports

Nothing about those is careless. They are what a competent reader writes when
asked for ``significance_status`` and told nothing further, and the prompt told
it nothing further: it named the five fields and never once listed a legal
value. ``normalize_research_result`` then returned ``None`` for the whole
payload, discarding the evidence and limitations along with it.

The fix is that the prompt renders ``RESULT_FIELD_CHOICES`` — the same table
the validator reads — so the two cannot drift apart, and the refusal names the
field and the value it rejected instead of the whole block.
