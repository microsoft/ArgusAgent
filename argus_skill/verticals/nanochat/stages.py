"""NanoChat Autoresearch vertical — Recursive "First Steps" **Task 1**.

Objective: MINIMIZE the mean validation bits-per-byte (``val_bpb``) of a small
GPT trained from scratch under a FIXED 300-second single-GPU budget (B200),
scored by the frozen harness over N seeds. Reference scores to beat (Recursive,
single B200, 10-seed mean):

    vanilla_transformer       1.0587   (the naive baseline / start point)
    optimized_from_vanilla    0.9344   (first target to beat)
    optimized_from_karpathy   0.9109   (Recursive's best — the bar)

This is its OWN vertical, DISTINCT from the nanoGPT *speedrun* (minimize wall
TIME to a target loss) and KernelBench/SOL (maximize a Speed-of-Light score)
verticals. It reuses the generic 4-stage setup→optimize→measure→report
structure and the flat-workspace STAGE_CHECKS / reviewer checklists (which are
already BPB-shaped); only the role banner pins the nanochat objective.
