"""Reviewer trust-first verification stance (operator directive 2026-06-26).

Root cause fixed: the reviewer prompt unconditionally told the reviewer to
re-run the engineer's commands itself and use *its own* output as ground truth.
On a trusted-scorer task that meant re-running the official scorer EVERY round
to re-confirm a number the engineer already obtained from that same frozen
scorer — burning the round for zero value and treating a no-reward engineer as
a suspect.

New stance (global): TRUST an honest, internally-consistent self-report; verify
only when evidence is MISSING or self-contradictory (the cheap anti-fabrication
floor that still stops a faked number); reinvest the round in judging the idea's
novelty + giving high-altitude direction. In MEASURED-BENCHMARK mode this is
sharpened and explicitly overrides the generic demand-evidence rules.
