"""Ask several independently-trained models for ideas, then let them argue.

One model asked once returns six candidates that share one model's taste and
one model's blind spots. Two models from different labs disagree about which
idea is worth a campaign, and the disagreement is the useful part: an objection
a GPT-family model cannot see is often obvious to a Gemini- or Claude-family
one, and a candidate that survives cross-examination by a stranger is a better
bet than one nobody argued with.

Availability decides the panel. Whatever CLIs are installed are the panel;
anything missing is skipped without comment, and a box with one usable backend
behaves exactly as it did before this module existed.
