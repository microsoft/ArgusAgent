"""fiction_writing intake adapter: shared Task Envelope -> fiction creative_brief.

This is the fiction end of the Task-Envelope closed loop. The envelope is the
SHARED cross-vertical task contract
(:mod:`argus_skill.verticals.literary.shared.task_envelope`);
fiction is its first real consumer. The ``creative_brief`` derived here stays
PRIVATE to fiction (viewpoint/tense/market_style/genre are narrative concepts a
poem or essay would not share).

The adapter refuses a task whose ``form`` is not a narrative-fiction form (e.g.
a poetry ``quatrain``), so a mis-routed task fails LOUDLY at intake rather than
silently producing an incoherent brief.
