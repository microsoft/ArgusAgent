# Argus maintenance review

- Read the complete diff and affected callers.
- Reject renaming or moving code that does not simplify behavior.
- Reject new wrappers, knobs, registries, or fallback paths without a current user.
- Check that core depends on the vertical contract rather than a concrete vertical.
- Run the decisive tests and build checks.
- Judge behavior and ownership, not warning-count reduction.
