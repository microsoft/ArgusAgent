"""End-to-end AAAI venue path: scaffold seed -> resolve -> every format gate.

Proves the seam composes: a project seeded with venue=aaai resolves to the AAAI
profile, and the layout gate, structural-minimums gate, stage checklist floor,
and venue reviewer skill selection all switch to AAAI rules — while the same
inputs keep EMNLP behavior for an EMNLP project.
