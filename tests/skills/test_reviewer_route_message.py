"""The operator-facing message when the model-backed prose review can't run.

`generate_academic_language_review` hard-blocks when it cannot reach a text
reviewer, and the underlying `_require_route` guidance is "configure api_key,
base_url, and model". On a copilot- or claude-backed reviewer that advice is
impossible to act on: those backends authenticate through their own CLI and
expose no OpenAI-style HTTP route, so the operator is told to set something
that does not exist for them.

These tests pin the fix and — more importantly — its two limits: the note must
not appear when a route IS configured (a real HTTP failure would be
mislabelled), and it must never turn a blocking gate into a passing one.
