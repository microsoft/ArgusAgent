        ``stall_threshold`` / ``soft_round_limit`` / ``hard_escalate_rounds``
        are ABSOLUTE round counts sized for the default ``max_rounds`` (32).
        A specialized caller may explicitly lower the budget for one mission,
        and a guard whose threshold is not strictly reachable within that
        budget can then never fire. Nothing reports this: the value stays in
        the config, is passed
        to the classifier, and evaluates to ``False`` on every round.

        Semantic stall is counted only from the Reviewer's structured
        ``FORWARD_PROGRESS=false`` judgment. The harness never derives it from
        verdict prose or filesystem activity.

        ``_runtime_execute`` already performs the mirror-image coordination in
        the unbounded direction (a progressive experiment matrix raises
        ``max_rounds`` and explicitly zeroes both escalation guards). This does
        the same for the bounded direction, generically.

        Rescaling preserves each guard's MEANING ("stop after this much
        fruitless work") expressed in the budget actually available:

        * ``stall_threshold`` needs ``streak >= threshold`` while
          ``round_index < max_rounds``; a streak cannot exceed the round
          index, so it must be ``<= max_rounds - 1``. If a configured
          multi-round threshold cannot fit at least two observations before the
          final round, it is disabled rather than silently becoming a one-strike
          policy. Callers may still request ``stall_threshold=1`` explicitly
          when a two-round budget should stop after its first negative verdict.
        * ``soft_round_limit`` advises the Reviewer partway through, so it
          must also land strictly inside the budget.
        * ``hard_escalate_rounds`` is the point where continuation must be backed
          by the Reviewer's explicit progress judgment. A missing signal ends
          with a planner-readable reason; reaching this boundary on the final
          round is still useful, so ``<= max_rounds`` is enough.

        A guard explicitly disabled with ``0`` stays disabled, and a budget
        large enough for the configured values is left byte-for-byte
        unchanged.
