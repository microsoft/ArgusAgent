# GitHub Copilot CLI adapter

**Evidence level:** locally tested on Copilot CLI 1.0.39 for binary/version, prompt/permission/path/remote/autopilot flags; discovery and approval behavior are also documented officially. Some docs describe newer command surfaces not exposed by this local build, so feature-detect.

- Discovery: project skills may be under `.github/skills`, `.claude/skills`, or `.agents/skills`; personal skills under `~/.copilot/skills` or `~/.agents/skills`. Copilot chooses by relevance or can be prompted with `/skill-name`. Current docs describe `/skills` reload/info and `copilot skill`; this local 1.0.39 help did not expose a `skill` subcommand, so use session `/skills` or filesystem discovery only after verifying the installed build.
- Shell/process: Copilot can run shell commands, edit files, and operate interactively or with `--prompt`. It supports PTY-like interactive shell shortcuts and resumable/remote sessions in this local build. Official docs do not establish a general durable local process manager for arbitrary child jobs; use Argus `--daemon` as the unattended substrate. Autopilot/remote session continuity is not proof that a shell child survives.
- Approvals: by default Copilot asks before tools that may mutate/execute. `--allow-tool`, `--deny-tool`, and write/path/URL controls are granular; deny wins. `--allow-all`/`--yolo` removes these prompts and path/URL restrictions and is not a default. Review skills before granting `allowed-tools: shell`.
- Paths/network: access defaults to the trusted working directory (plus documented temporary-directory behavior); use a dedicated workdir and explicitly approved added paths. URL permissions are separate from shell/write permission.
- Limit: local and cloud sandboxes are preview and may differ. Feature-detect `/sandbox`, skill reload, and remote controls rather than hard-requiring them.
- Model: Copilot CLI is the outer operator. A Copilot CLI or model configured inside Argus is an implementation detail of Argus, not another peer.
