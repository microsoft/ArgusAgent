"""Manager-owned routing for evidence-backed mission challenges.

This module does not judge whether the Reviewer's technical claim is true. It
keeps the authority boundary explicit: operator-owned changes go back to the
operator, while technical alternatives may revise or replace the Planner's
working plan. The Planner still inspects the evidence and authors any replacement
DAG.
