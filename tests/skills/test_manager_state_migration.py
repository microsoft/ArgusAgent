"""Importing a workdir's ``.argus/PIPELINE_STATE.json`` into the state root.

This runs inside ``build_life_runner``, so anything it raises does not surface
as itself: it kills the front-door runner, and the operator is told the Manager
"could not classify this message ... please retry". That makes the difference
between the two failure shapes matter more than it looks — one is a real fault
worth stopping for, and the other was a project that had simply not been
classified yet.
