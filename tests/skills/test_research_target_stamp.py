"""Regression test: re-affirming a research target must not retire evidence.

``research_target_set_at`` is the cutoff ``_research_project_done_issue`` uses
to retire certifications earned against an *earlier, different* target. It was
stamped on every ``persist_vertical`` call that carried a level, including the
overwhelmingly common case of a caller re-persisting the level it had just
read. Each re-stamp moved the cutoff past every journal entry, so the gate
loop — which walks newest-first and breaks at the first mission older than the
cutoff — could never find a certification and rejected Planner completion
forever.

Observed live in run 8 (s-fed750c2): the universal-moduli problem was solved
and formalized in Lean in mission 1, and missions 2, 3 and 4 were all attempts
to certify that same finished work, each independently reviewed ``done`` and
each answered with ``missing_exploratory_reviewer_certification``.
