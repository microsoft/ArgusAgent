"""Catch backlog items that never went through the Manager.

`backlog.jsonl` is an ordinary file. An outer agent — Copilot, Claude Code,
whatever is driving the box — can append a row to it and the daemon will
execute that row as a mission. Nothing is corrupted, and that is the problem:
the item skipped `manager_bounded_handoff`, so no vertical was chosen, no
stage or target level was set, and the workflow mode defaulted.

The visible symptom is a Manager that appears to do nothing. A literature-review
task lands as a bare objective, the run proceeds under the default flow, and
the vertical the operator expected never engages. Nothing errors, so nothing
draws attention to it.

File permissions cannot close this — the agent has full filesystem access, and
writing to the backlog is a reasonable thing to want to do. So this does not
block the write. It marks items the Manager decided on, notices the ones it
did not, and routes those back through the Manager before they execute. The
back door becomes another way in through the front.
