"""Smoke test for the vertical re-export anchor.

The point of this test is structural, not behavioral: confirm that
``argus_skill.verticals.research`` exposes the paper-specific names
that future code is supposed to depend on, and that those names are
the same objects as the ones still served by the legacy
``argus_skill.skills`` / ``argus_skill.tools`` import paths. The
underlying modules can later be physically relocated under
``argus_skill/verticals/research/`` without breaking either contract.
