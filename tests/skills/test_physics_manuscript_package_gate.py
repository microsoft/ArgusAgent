"""Regression: the review-stage manuscript-package advisory gate surfaces the
deterministic terminal-contract failures + an executable repair loop as soon as a
paper package exists — the root-cause fix for the Case B ``no_progress`` stall.

Before the fix, ``verify_all_deliverables`` was only run at the terminal
``manuscript`` stage HARD gate, so a paper package produced at ``review`` never
handed the agent a concrete failure list; the reviewer stalled and the mission
died ``no_progress`` before the manuscript stage. This gate runs the SAME checker
at ``review`` (advisory), writes the failure list through the shared
``research_gates`` machinery, and thereby feeds it into the physics ``role_banner``
repair blocks.
