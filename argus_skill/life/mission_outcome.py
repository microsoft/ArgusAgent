    explicitly asked to continue, and the task signature is quarantined out of
    replanning, so the run sits idle with an unfinished objective and an empty

    Deliberately narrow. A success needs no resumption, and ``blocked``,
    ``failed`` and an operator abort stop for reasons no review verdict may
    override: a pending operator question, a crash, and an explicit stop.
