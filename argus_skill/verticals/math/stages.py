    is LLM-judged prose. None of it asks the one question this mode exists to
    ask: is G proved or refuted?

    ``ProofGraph.gap()`` has answered that since it was written and had exactly

    """Structural defects in the claim ledger, when the project keeps one.

    The same rule as the Lean sources above, for the same reason. A project with
    no ``research/MATH_STATE.json`` pays nothing: ``load_state`` reads a missing
    file as an empty state, and an empty state has no defects, so absence needs
    no special case here. A project that does keep a ledger has to keep one that
    holds together — a claim stated against a superseded context, or evidence
    bound to a statement the claim no longer carries, is exactly the kind of
    drift that makes a status mean less than it reads.

    Until this call the ledger was advisory: ``proof_ledger`` derived
    ``closed_kernel`` and ``conditional_kernel`` and nothing consulted the
    answer, so a project could finish a stage with a ledger contradicting
    itself. ``StateIssue.rendered()`` was written for this — it produces the
    same ``path: message`` shape ``lean_evidence`` and ``literature_ledger``
    already emit, so all three render alike here.

    What this deliberately does *not* do is let a claim's derived status decide
    whether the mission is complete. That question belongs with the objective
    mode and the requested bar below, it is a policy judgement rather than a
    structural one, and conflating the two would make "the ledger is consistent"
    and "the mathematics is finished" the same check when they are not.

    An unreadable ledger is reported as a defect rather than raised. Letting
    ``MathStateError`` escape would take down the completion gate for every
    other check with it, and a gate that reports nothing is indistinguishable
    from a gate that found nothing wrong.

    ``certificate_issues`` is asked alongside the kernel's own ``validate``
    because the kernel does not know what a Lean certificate is, and the defect
    it catches — a fidelity verdict still standing after the reading it approved
    was replaced — is precisely one a stage must not complete over. Both render
    the same way, so the caller cannot tell which found what, and does not need

    The half of research mathematics no proof checker touches. Lean can verify
    that a theorem follows from its hypotheses and say nothing about whether the
    hypothesis imported as "Theorem 3.2 of [K]" is in [K] at all — and a
    fabricated or misquoted citation is not a formatting defect, it is a proof
    that does not exist, wearing a reference. So this is asked once, here, and it
    is the only citation gate: ``scope`` and ``solve`` complete with citations in
    any state, because a checker that interrupted the mathematics to wait on a
    registry would simply be turned off.

    ``confirmed`` and ``uncited`` are the two states that pass, and the second is
    not a loophole. An assumption that records prose and no locator has said
    plainly that it leans on something unciteable — a private communication, an
    unpublished note — which a reader can weigh. What must not pass is the
    citation that *looks* checkable and was never checked, and its neighbour: a
    ``disputed`` one, where somebody did go and found the proposition missing.
    That is settled work and it still must not ship, which is why this asks a
    narrower question than ``CitationAssessment.is_settled``.

    Both remedies work with no network, because a gate whose only remedy needs
    one is a gate that traps an offline run: a reader who has the paper records
    what it says with ``citation_check attribute``, and a source that genuinely
    cannot be obtained is restated in prose, which drops the claim to ``uncited``

    ``_resolve_lake_workspace``, whose first and highest-priority step is "a
    lakefile above the source". An Engineer who cannot see that a workspace
    exists does the obvious thing and writes its own lakefile into the project
    root, which *is* that first step, and so shadows the built library with an
    empty one. The promise then costs a full Mathlib fetch and build to keep:
    run 7 duplicated 7.5 GB into the project while a built workspace sat
    unused. Naming the path is the whole remedy — it turns an invisible default
    into something the agent can choose.

    Resolved at call time rather than at import: the search re-reads
    ``Path.home()`` and ``$ARGUS_SKILL_MATHLIB_WORKSPACE`` on every call, and a
    banner quoting a path the search does not use would be worse than silence.
    Fail-soft for the same reason — a host without Mathlib should get no
    paragraph, not a paragraph about a directory that is not there.
