"""Twenty of twenty-three verticals could never complete. Regression guard.

Observed live on 2026-07-26 in
``/tmp/argus-night/home/projects/ce3bdc5a5291/events.jsonl`` (and earlier in
``/tmp/argus-ux-home-current/projects/s-5d812960/events.jsonl``): the Reviewer
returned ``done`` and certified the delivery stage, the Manager's stage decision
agreed, the mission completed — and the Planner immediately re-issued the
identical task "Complete and certify the current Goal Gate". Twenty-one provider
calls and about $1.085 in the first session, with no progress.

Three rules interlocked, each defensible alone:

1. ``_planner_task_tags`` downgrades a ``final_submission`` scope to ``bounded``
   for any vertical whose completion gate is not ``full_paper``;
2. ``tick()`` retires a persisted ``final_submission`` item under such a
   vertical as stale — which is *why* rule 1 exists;
3. ``final_stage_completion_decision`` accepted nothing but
   ``final_submission``.

So the mission created specifically to close the Goal Gate carried the one scope
that could never close it, and no amount of Reviewer certification could write
the completion certificate the Planner was waiting for.

A first attempt fixed this at the TaskSpec, setting ``scope="final_submission"``
on the Goal Gate task. Running a real daemon showed the tag still persisted as
``scope:bounded`` — rule 1 silently downgraded it — so that change was reverted
rather than left as a no-op. The lesson is in the first test below: assert the
property end to end over the real vertical registry, not one link of a chain.
