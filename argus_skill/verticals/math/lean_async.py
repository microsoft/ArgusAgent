"""Compiling Lean without holding the mathematician still.

``verify`` in :mod:`.lean_evidence` blocks its caller for the whole compile. On
a source that imports Mathlib that is minutes, and the caller is a reasoning
agent, so the cost is minutes of a mathematician doing nothing. This module adds
the other shape of the same step: ``submit`` starts the compile and returns a
handle, ``reclaim`` turns that handle into exactly the records ``verify`` would
have written.

Nothing here weakens the rule ``verify`` enforces, and one part of it has to be
*stronger*, because the window is wider. Two separate mechanisms, both required:

**The compile reads a snapshot.** ``submit`` copies the canonical source and the
statement fidelity document into a per-run staging directory and compiles the
copy. This is not a convenience. A compiler launched against a live file reads
that file when it gets to it, not when it was launched — measured, not
assumed — so an in-place background compile answers about whatever text the
Engineer last saved, while the digest stamped at submit names the text that was
there before. That pair is a forgery of precisely the kind
``_refuse_if_moved_under_the_compiler`` exists to prevent, and stretching the
window from "one compile" to "however long the agent was away" makes it the
normal case rather than a race. Compiling a copy makes the answer be about a
fixed text by construction.

**Publication still checks the live files.** A fixed text is not the same as a
current one. ``reclaim`` re-reads the project's own source and fidelity document
and refuses if either no longer matches what was compiled — nothing published,
no result, no log, no certificate, no ledger evidence, and the remedy is to
submit again. So the snapshot buys the freedom to keep editing while a compile
runs; it does not buy the right to publish an answer about text the project no
longer carries.

The third distinction this module has to keep is the one the rest of the
vertical keeps everywhere: an environment failure is worded differently from a
broken proof. A background process that died without writing an answer produced
*no verdict at all*, so ``reclaim`` says the run was lost and writes nothing. It
must never be able to reach a reader as ``lean_compile_failed``.

Process death is allowed to cost one recompile. There is no daemon, no timer,
and no reconciliation: a handle is a directory on disk, and every question about
it is answered by looking.
