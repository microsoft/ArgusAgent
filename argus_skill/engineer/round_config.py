        ``stall_threshold`` / ``soft_round_limit`` / ``hard_escalate_rounds``
        are ABSOLUTE round counts sized for the default ``max_rounds`` (500).
        A caller may lower the budget far below them for one mission —
        ``bounded_dag_node_max_rounds()`` yields 3 — and a guard whose
        threshold is not strictly reachable within the budget can then never
        fire. Nothing reports this: the value stays in the config, is passed
        to the classifier, and evaluates to ``False`` on every round.

        Semantic stall is counted only from the Reviewer's structured
        ``FORWARD_PROGRESS=false`` judgment. The harness never derives it from
        verdict prose or filesystem activity.

        ``_runtime_execute`` already performs the mirror-image coordination in
        the unbounded direction (a progressive experiment matrix raises
        ``max_rounds`` and explicitly zeroes both escalation guards). This does
        the same for the bounded direction, generically.

        Rescaling preserves each guard's MEANING ("stop after this much
        fruitless work") expressed in the budget actually available:

        * ``stall_threshold`` needs ``streak >= threshold`` while
          ``round_index < max_rounds``; a streak cannot exceed the round
          index, so it must be ``<= max_rounds - 1``. If a configured
          multi-round threshold cannot fit at least two observations before the
          final round, it is disabled rather than silently becoming a one-strike
          policy. Callers may still request ``stall_threshold=1`` explicitly
          when a two-round budget should stop after its first negative verdict.
        * ``soft_round_limit`` advises the Reviewer partway through, so it
          must also land strictly inside the budget.
        * ``hard_escalate_rounds`` force-ends the loop with a planner-readable
          reason; firing on the final round is still better than the generic
          ``Hit max_rounds`` path, so ``<= max_rounds`` is enough.

        A guard explicitly disabled with ``0`` stays disabled, and a budget
        large enough for the configured values is left byte-for-byte
        unchanged.
