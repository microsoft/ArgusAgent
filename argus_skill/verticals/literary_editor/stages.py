"""literary_editor-vertical stage definitions.

The FIFTH literary consumer — an EDITING service over existing text, reusing the
framework Reviewer + revise capability. It consumes the same four shared contracts
as the genre verticals. Its machine layer is EDIT DISCIPLINE (genuinely
deterministic); whether the edit is GOOD is live-reviewer.

Stages (``completion_gate="none"``):
1. **intake**: record ``editor/task_envelope.json`` + ``editor/source.txt`` +
   derive ``editor/edit_brief.json`` (mode, goal, must_keep, allow_new_facts).
2. **diagnose**: reviewer emits ``editor/review.json`` — findings on the SOURCE
   against the goal (edit-discipline blocking + craft live).
3. **revision_plan**: ``editor/revision_plan.json`` derived from the review.
4. **edit**: produce ``editor/edited.txt`` honoring the mode + must_keep.
5. **verify**: machine edit-check + ``editor/change_summary.json`` +
   ``editor/artifact_manifest.json``.
