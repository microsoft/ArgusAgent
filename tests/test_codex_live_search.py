"""codex live web_search (idea-stage) wiring — the ``web_search="live"`` feature.

Idea discovery runs in the research stage; there the engineer enables codex's
native live web_search so literature grounding is real, not cached/recalled.
These tests pin the four links of the chain:
  1. RunnerOptions.live_search -> ``-c web_search="live"`` in the codex command
  2. the core->agent_cli options translation carries the flag
  3. the research-stage gate turns it on for research, off elsewhere
  4. the ACTIVE VERTICAL owns which of its own stages get it; the framework
     default (research) only applies to a vertical that declares nothing
