"""Regression test: a refused completion must say which check refused.

``final_stage_completion_decision`` answers yes-or-no across four independent
checks — stage position, external gate, mission scope, reviewer certification —
and returns a bare ``None`` for every no. Its one caller turned that into a
single sentence, "Manager completion rejected by the project completion
contract", identical for all four.

That sentence is the whole feedback loop. Testbed run 13 (``s-d9ea298f``) hit
the *stage position* check with the problem fully solved: a reproducible search
program, a both-directions proof of the characterization, and a Lean 4 build
containing ``universal_24`` and ``not_universal_48`` with no ``sorry`` and no
``axiom``, all reviewer-certified. The actual answer was "you are at ``scope``;
completion is only legal at ``review``". What the Planner did with the opaque
version was queue a mission titled "Certify the scope-stage Goal Gate", whose
objective included "record the missing route/ledger state or equivalent gate
metadata if required by the workflow" — inventing gate bookkeeping to explain a
refusal it had no way to read.
