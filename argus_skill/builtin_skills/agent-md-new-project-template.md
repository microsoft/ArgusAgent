## Title
AGENTS.md New Project Template

## When to use
- Use this when creating a new autonomous AI research workspace whose deliverable is a submission-quality paper for a selected current venue.
- Use it before the daemon chooses the final thesis, benchmark, method name, paper story, figure design, or completion criteria.

## When NOT to use
- Do not use this to continue or repair an existing paper with valuable artifacts, tests, user edits, or an operator-approved direction. Use the existing-project optimization template instead.
- Do not fill it with copied titles, claims, benchmark choices, result numbers, figures, or generated artifacts from another project.
- Direction rule: the operator's most recent explicit instruction wins. Use this template when the operator rejects the current direction or asks for a fresh start. If raw data, logs, or evidence from an older project should remain usable, list them as allowed inputs; do not preserve the older thesis, architecture, benchmark framing, or paper story by default.

## Copy-ready `AGENTS.md`

# AGENTS.md

## Project contract
This workspace must produce a submission-quality, venue-aware AI research paper,
not a pilot PDF, reviewer-gaming demo, or renamed copy of an older project.
Build it as an evidence pipeline: research -> plan -> benchmark -> run ->
analysis -> draft -> review -> submission.

This is a clean-slate project. Do not inherit titles, claims, datasets, benchmark episodes, generators, figures, review artifacts, result numbers, architecture, thesis, or paper story from any prior project unless they are listed in **Allowed starting inputs** with source, license/access status, allowed use, and rationale.

Non-negotiable research bar: choose an important, falsifiable problem grounded
in current primary sources. Final empirical claims must include appropriate
public benchmark/data/task evidence. Synthetic/local diagnostics may supplement
but not replace public evidence. Positive, negative, diagnostic, and boundary
contributions are all valid when they have research value.

**Research taste is mandatory.** The operator gives you a research DIRECTION, not a paper plan. You must find your own insight:
- Survey the field first. Read code, not just abstracts. Find what existing methods miss.
- Your paper needs a 'WHY' — not just 'we applied X to Y and it worked'.
- Simple reproduction of existing work is NOT a paper. You must have a novel thesis.
- If you can't articulate what makes your approach surprising or counter-intuitive, keep searching.
- Write `research/IDEA_REJECTION_LOG.md` — reject at least one mediocre idea before committing.

## Binding playbooks and completion contract
- Read and follow the operator-provided research playbook when one is available before choosing the final thesis, benchmark, method name, metric, paper narrative, figure/table design, or final preflight.
- Use the active Argus package/source checkout supplied by the launcher. Built-in skill markdown is available as project-local exports under `./argus_builtin_skills/` and as the Python package resource `argus_skill.builtin_skills`; `ARGUS_SKILL_SOURCE_ROOT` may point at a source checkout, but agents must not hard-code host-specific paths.
- At project setup, copy the built-in skill markdown into this workspace so the daemon can read it directly:
  `"${ARGUS_SKILL_PYTHON:-python}" -m argus_skill --export-builtin-skills ./argus_builtin_skills`
- Read `./argus_builtin_skills/*.md` and `./argus_builtin_skills/**/*.md` first when invoking built-in paper/research/domain skills. If the local copy is absent or stale, refresh it with the export command above or load `argus_skill.builtin_skills` through the active Python environment. Do not copy the whole Argus repository, global memory, model caches, or capability vault into this project.
- When ownership is unclear, resolve the target venue first, then load that
  venue's drafting/preflight/review router; do not hard-code EMNLP.
- Prefer `"${ARGUS_SKILL_PYTHON:-python}" -m argus_skill ...` for Argus helper commands; the launcher injects `ARGUS_SKILL_PYTHON`, `ARGUS_SKILL_SOURCE_ROOT`, and `PYTHONPATH` when a source checkout is needed.
- Final completion is certified only when the L2 reviewer returns a
  `scope: final_submission` verdict with `status: done` and concrete evidence
  covering the full pipeline and selected venue.
- Full-scale experiment evidence is a prerequisite for analysis, draft, review, and submission. The L2 reviewer must tick off the run-stage "full-scale evidence" checklist item before any of those stages are marked ready/done.
- Treat `missing_full_scale_experiment_run`, `incomplete_full_scale_experiment_run`, `missing_baseline_condition_run`, and `pilot_pdf_without_full_scale_evidence` as hard blockers.
- Before final academic/layout review, the L2 reviewer must tick off the analysis/draft-stage paper-quality checklist items.
- A single pipeline-state checklist item, a compiled PDF, a pilot run, or a passing review artifact alone is not final readiness; only the reviewer's full final-submission checklist certifies completion.

## Skill route
Before each planner or engineer round, classify the current blocker and load
only the focused skill. Venue-specific drafting/review skills come from the
selected venue profile and official author kit.

| Current blocker / task | Read this skill first | Use it to decide or produce |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stage order, readiness state, pivots, or "what next?" | `argus_builtin_skills/auto-research-pipeline.md` | `research/PIPELINE_STATE.json`, stage gates, when to move backward from paper drafting to experiments |
| Experiment implementation, public-benchmark runs, comparisons, controls, progress files | `argus_builtin_skills/engineer/research-experiment-runner.md` | runnable harnesses, manifests, status/progress, raw evidence, cancellation |
| Results analysis, result tables, and research figures | `argus_builtin_skills/engineer/research-results-analysis-and-figures.md` + research vertical `research-visualization-router.md` | `RESULTS_REPORT.md`, result-to-claim tables, figure source/render/review artifacts, `FIGURE_PROVENANCE.json`; image-2 outputs also retain `IMAGE2_FIGURES.json` |
| Exemplar PDFs, page rhythm, structure blueprint, conformance | `argus_builtin_skills/paper-exemplar-pdf-learning.md` | exemplar PDFs/text, `STYLE_PROFILE.md`, `PAPER_STRUCTURE_BLUEPRINT.md`, structure conformance artifacts |
| First LaTeX draft, citations, bibliography, narrative | selected venue drafting skill + official author kit | `paper/main.tex`, page/word budget, draft report, BibTeX connected to claims |
| Format, page/word budget, references, appendix/checklist flow | selected venue format preflight | classify whether to fix layout/prose or route back to evidence |
| Weak claims, unsupported numbers, evidence gaps, stale artifacts | `argus_builtin_skills/claims-evidence-audit.md` | source-level claim/result corrections and the smallest missing experiment |
| Academic tone and model-backed prose critique after evidence is stable | selected venue academic-language review | fresh `ACADEMIC_LANGUAGE_REVIEW.json` and concrete directives |
| Iterative paper repair after review feedback | `argus_builtin_skills/paper-review-revision-loop.md` | source-level revisions plus review reruns, without hand-editing stale generated outputs |
| Final paper review | `argus_builtin_skills/research-submission-assurance-gate.md` | independent reading of the current manuscript, PDF, and claim-critical sources |

Routing rule: if the blocker is "paper is too short", "format looks fake", "references look bad", or "figure is wrong", first determine whether evidence/full-scale runs/claim support are missing. Missing evidence routes to benchmark execution or analysis before prose/layout polish.

## Operator goal
- Primary paper goal: [write the target research problem and deliverable]
- Target venue/scope: explicit operator venue, otherwise live-select a relevant
  CCF-A conference whose deadline has not passed and build its venue profile
- Success condition: the L2 reviewer certifies `done` against the full pipeline checklist (scope: final_submission) plus a current PDF/submission package
- Non-goals: [write what must not be optimized, copied, or claimed]
- Allowed compute/API budget: [write limits and stop conditions]

## Allowed starting inputs
List every starting input before using it:

| Input | Source/path/URL | License/access | How it may be used | Why it is appropriate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [input] | [source] | [status] | [allowed use] | [rationale] |

If an input is not listed here, treat it as unavailable until documented. Raw evidence may be reused only as evidence; it does not carry over the old thesis, narrative, or figure design.

## Required project skeleton
Use the repository's existing conventions if they are already present; otherwise create the closest equivalent:

| Area | Required artifacts |
| --- | --- |
| Research | `research/RESEARCH_BRIEF.md`, canonical `research/LITERATURE_GROUNDING.json`, generated `research/LIT_MATRIX.tsv`, `research/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md` |
| Experiments | benchmark source/provenance files, run manifests, `status.json`, `progress.jsonl`, raw result JSON/TSV, logs, STOP-file contract |
| Style references | `paper/style_ref/exemplars/<slug>/paper.pdf`, extracted text, `paper/style_ref/EXEMPLAR.json`, `paper/style_ref/EXEMPLAR_SUITABILITY.json`, `paper/style_ref/STYLE_PROFILE.md`, `paper/style_ref/PAPER_STRUCTURE_BLUEPRINT.md`, `paper/style_ref/STRUCTURE_CONFORMANCE.md`, `paper/style_ref/STRUCTURE_CONFORMANCE.json`, `paper/style_ref/SOURCES.md` |
| Claim support | canonical raw results, analysis scripts, paper tables/figures, and verified primary citations |
| Local Argus skills | `argus_builtin_skills/*.md` and `argus_builtin_skills/**/*.md` exported from the active `argus_skill.builtin_skills` package/source checkout |
| Reviews | Reviewer feedback plus optional language/layout tool output when a concrete doubt needs a second opinion |

## Model/API and helper-code contract
1. Model and image credentials are operator capabilities, not project artifacts. The private vault is `~/.argus-skill/capabilities/model_api.json` or `ARGUS_SKILL_CAPABILITY_VAULT`; it should be mode `0600`. Do not manually open/read, print, summarize, copy, or commit its raw contents; only Argus route helpers/tools may load it at runtime.
2. Before model-backed work, run the secret-free status check:
   `"${ARGUS_SKILL_PYTHON:-python}" -m argus_skill --model-api-status`
   Use the reported routes: `engineer` for code/evaluation helpers, `reviewer` for audits, `image` for image-2/codex-image2 generation, and `image_review` for visual inspection. If a needed route is unavailable but operator-approved environment/Codex config exists, initialize once with:
   `"${ARGUS_SKILL_PYTHON:-python}" -m argus_skill --init-model-api`
3. Put reusable project wrappers under `code/`; do not scatter raw API calls through notebooks, paper generators, or review JSON writers. Use `load_model_api_route(...)` from Argus, not hard-coded keys, base URLs, or model names. Route-specific environment overrides such as `ARGUS_SKILL_IMAGE_MODEL=gpt-image-2`, `ARGUS_SKILL_IMAGE_BASE_URL`, and `ARGUS_SKILL_IMAGE_API_KEY` may be used only as process environment, never as committed text.
4. No model wrapper is pre-seeded. If the task needs model calls, create a small
   project-owned helper such as `code/llm.py` instead of scattering raw HTTP calls.
   Preserve transient 429/5xx/URL
   retry with exponential backoff and `Retry-After` handling. Do not convert a rate-limit,
   disconnect, or temporary backend error directly into a deterministic fallback answer for an
   experiment row; retry first, then record the failure explicitly if the route is still unusable.
   Minimal `code/llm.py` pattern for text calls:

       from __future__ import annotations

       import json
       import time
       import urllib.error
       import urllib.request
       from typing import Any

       from argus_skill.tools.capability_vault import ModelApiRoute, load_model_api_route

       TRANSIENT_HTTP_STATUS_CODES = {429, 500, 502, 503, 504}

       def _route(name: str) -> ModelApiRoute:
           route = load_model_api_route(name)
           if route is None or not route.usable:
               raise RuntimeError(f"model API route {name!r} is unavailable; run --model-api-status")
           return route

       def _retry_delay_seconds(exc: BaseException, attempt: int) -> float | None:
           if isinstance(exc, urllib.error.HTTPError):
               if exc.code not in TRANSIENT_HTTP_STATUS_CODES:
                   return None
               retry_after = exc.headers.get("Retry-After") if exc.headers else None
               if retry_after:
                   try:
                       return max(1.0, float(retry_after))
                   except ValueError:
                       pass
           elif not isinstance(exc, urllib.error.URLError):
               return None
           return min(60.0, 2.0 * (2**attempt))

       def _post(route: ModelApiRoute, endpoint: str, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
           req = urllib.request.Request(
               f"{route.base_url.rstrip('/')}/{endpoint.lstrip('/')}",
               data=json.dumps(payload).encode("utf-8"),
               headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {route.api_key}", "Content-Type": "application/json"},
               method="POST",
           )
           for attempt in range(5):
               try:
                   with urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=180) as resp:  # noqa: S310 - Argus capability route
                       return json.loads(resp.read().decode("utf-8"))
               except (urllib.error.HTTPError, urllib.error.URLError) as exc:
                   delay = _retry_delay_seconds(exc, attempt)
                   if delay is None or attempt == 4:
                       raise
                   time.sleep(delay)
           raise RuntimeError("unreachable")

       def complete(prompt: str, *, route_name: str = "text", system: str = "") -> str:
           route = _route(route_name)
           if route.wire_api == "chat":
               data = _post(route, "/chat/completions", {
                   "model": route.model,
                   "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": system}, {"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
               })
               return data["choices"][0]["message"]["content"].strip()
           data = _post(route, "/responses", {
               "model": route.model,
               "input": [{"role": "system", "content": system}, {"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
           })
           if isinstance(data.get("output_text"), str):
               return data["output_text"].strip()
           return "\n".join(
               part.get("text", "").strip()
               for item in data.get("output", [])
               for part in item.get("content", [])
               if isinstance(part, dict) and part.get("text")
           )

5. For image-2 Figure 1 generation, prefer the Argus image tool and preserve the exact raster it returns:

       "${ARGUS_SKILL_PYTHON:-python}" -m argus_skill.tools.image_api generate \
         --prompt-file paper/figures/method_overview.prompt.txt \
         --out paper/figures/method_overview.png \
         --size 1536x1024 --force
       "${ARGUS_SKILL_PYTHON:-python}" -m argus_skill.tools.image_api inspect \
         --image paper/figures/method_overview.png > paper/figures/method_overview.inspect.json
       "${ARGUS_SKILL_PYTHON:-python}" -m argus_skill.verticals.research.figure_tool review \
         --image paper/figures/method_overview.png \
         --prompt-file paper/figures/method_overview.prompt.txt \
         --out paper/figures/method_overview.review.json

   A helper such as `code/generate_image2_figure.py` must then write `paper/figures/IMAGE2_FIGURES.json` with `figure_id`, `figure_type`, `model` or `generator_model`, `prompt_path`, `output_path`, `output_sha256`, `sidecar_path`, `inspect_path`, `review_path`, `generation_provenance_path`, width, and height. The sidecar must preserve image-tool/API evidence (`/images/generations`, model, created time, prompt SHA, output SHA, dimensions), and `review_path` must come from the `image_review` model route. `generation_provenance_path` may point at the image sidecar if that JSON records `prompt_path`, `output_path`, and `output_sha256`. Never crop, downsample, resave, PDF-wrap, locally redraw the accepted raster, or hand-fill `codex-image2` metadata around a local PNG after provenance is written.
6. Do not let the model freehand a one-paragraph image prompt. Before calling image-2, create `paper/figures/method_overview.prompt.txt` with `python -m argus_skill.verticals.research.figure_tool paper-prompt ...`; it is the recommended canonical prompt (carrying the `argus-image2-paper-prompt-v1` and `paper-framework-figure-studio-pro-v3.1.4a` markers), then generate as many layout variants as needed (up to 20) by changing only the layout/candidate-contract fields; keep the best reviewed raster and record the selected `prompt_variant_id` in provenance or the manifest:

       Use case: scientific-educational
       Prompt template: argus-image2-paper-prompt-v1
       Prompt source: paper-framework-figure-studio-pro-v3.1.4a
       Asset type: Figure 1 teaser / conceptual overview for the selected venue.

       General style:
       - Selected-venue AI paper method figure, adaptive landscape, 1536x1024 or 1920x1088.
       - Clean Figma-style block diagram / block-based Figma style with rounded cards, neat alignment, soft pastel fills, dark-gray 2px borders, and compact information density.
       - Compact, information-rich, suitable for a PDF page-width figure; little wasted space but not crowded.
       - Tidy rounded handwritten or friendly sans-serif feel is acceptable only if it remains crisp and readable; no messy sketch fonts.
       - Moderate badge/icon use only when semantically useful; a few simple recognizable icons are fine, not a logo wall.
       - No heavy shadows, no gradients, no photorealism, no glassmorphism, no messy Excalidraw look.
       - Large readable labels, short phrases, balanced hierarchy, flat vector-like raster rendering on warm white #fbfaf7.

       Style intent:
       - Clean, dense, modular, Figma-like, mostly rounded cards, low-saturation pastel blocks.
       - Use small badges/icons sparingly; avoid empty space while preserving alignment.
       - It should look like a main figure in the selected venue, not a marketing graphic, stock illustration, dashboard screenshot, or casual whiteboard.

       Pinned content that must appear exactly:
       - Title: "<short human-readable method/system name>"
       - Show: "<source/input>" -> "<parse/build/distill step>" -> "<quality/verification gate>" -> "<memory/library/model state>" -> "<agent/execution step>" -> "<output/result>" -> "<benchmark/evidence protocol>".
       - Components/chips: "<baseline/status quo>", "<proposed method>", "<accepted item>", "<rejected item>", "<main metric/evidence>", "<failure avoided>".
       - SPELL EXACTLY every quoted label above. Do not invent alternate terminology, code identifiers, raw artifact paths, or extra labels.

       Layout variant:
       - Pick one variant ID and name it in the prompt. Swap only this block when generating variants.
       - 01 central hero: huge central memory/wiki/library card, source factory on the left, agent/output board on the right, benchmark strip at bottom.
       - 02 horizontal swimlanes: three clean lanes such as Build, Verify, Execute; use offset cards so it is not too rigid.
       - 03 sankey funnel: many sources merge into distillation, narrow through gates, expand into library/state, then branch to outputs.
       - 04 exploded entry: one accepted skill/memory/wiki entry pulled apart into Text, Visual, Recipe, Metadata plates with callout arrows.
       - 05 layered architecture stack: bottom sources, middle reusable memory/library, top agent execution; use shelf-like overlapping slabs.
       - 06 pipeline plus gallery: main pipeline across top, output gallery on right, compact benchmark/evidence cards along bottom.
       - 07 modular dashboard: dense but paper-clean cards; central method card largest, side panel for domains/tasks/outputs.
       - 08 radial hub-spoke: reusable library/state as center hub; sources feed from left arc; agent/results radiate right; evidence panel below.
       - 09 zigzag pipeline: Z-shaped reading path with numbered step badges and compact insets.
       - 10 research-poster dense: section headers, compact cards, mini charts, and small output thumbnails; still clean Figma and paper-friendly.
       - 11 grayscale accent: mostly grayscale academic style with two pastel accent colors for proposed path and verification.
       - 12 color-coded phases: peach acquisition, blue memory/library, green agent, lavender domains, yellow benchmark; overlapping phase tabs.
       - 13 card deck: sources, skills, and outputs as tidy fanned decks; one accepted card expanded.
       - 14 computation graph: nodes and grouped modules with thin arrows and rounded containers, like an ML systems diagram.
       - 15 dataflow with sidebars: main flow through center, left source sidebar, right output sidebar, bottom benchmark/evidence sidebar.
       - 16 timeline plus insets: left-to-right timeline with zoom boxes for the core mechanism and output/evidence.
       - 17 nested containers: big containers for Offline Construction and Online Execution; nested subcards plus benchmark footer.
       - 18 multi-panel A/B/C/D: A sources/build, B reusable state, C agent execution, D benchmark/evidence; panels overlap slightly and share arrows.
       - 19 light blueprint: pale blue grid background, modular boxes, thin connector routes, neat badges, strong central method box.
       - 20 polished Figma wireframe: component frames, auto-layout-like spacing, section tabs, chips, and carefully staggered components.

       Negative prompt / Avoid:
       - no concrete code snippets, raw paths, tiny unreadable text, character-level vertical text, or dense paragraphs
       - no excessive logos or brand marks, no watermark
       - no photorealistic scenes, stock photos, glassmorphism, heavy gradients, heavy shadows, texture, or arbitrary decorative blobs
       - no messy whiteboard / Excalidraw-heavy sketch style
       - no large empty areas, overlapping cards, squashed labels, inconsistent terminology, or extra captions that make it look like a dashboard

       Figma tokens for camera-ready cleanup:
       - Canvas 1536x1024 or 1920x1088; background #fbfaf7; stroke #1f2933 at 2px.
       - Corner radius 10-16px; card padding 12-20px; card gap 12-24px.
       - Pastels: acquisition #ffe2d1, parsing #fff2bd, memory/wiki #dcecff, agent #e2f7df, domains #eadfff, benchmark #fff1c9.
       - Text sizes: title 38-52px, section headers 22-30px, card labels 16-22px, chips 12-16px.

   A prompt that lacks `argus-image2-paper-prompt-v1`, `paper-framework-figure-studio-pro-v3.1.4a`, `General style`, `Pinned content`, exact spelling instructions, `Layout variant`, and `Negative prompt / Avoid` is a blocker even if the image API call succeeds.

## Role model
- Planner: decomposes the paper into gated research tasks and chooses the next blocker with the highest reviewer value.
- Engineer: implements benchmarks, experiments, generators, LaTeX, and fixes; edits source/generators rather than patching generated outputs.
- Reviewer: checks evidence, freshness, paper quality, and whether the completion command actually passed.

## Research and experiment plan contract
1. Start from a research brief, not from a paper title.
2. Before selecting the final thesis, survey credible sources: recent high-quality papers, classic anchor papers, benchmark/dataset papers, official repos, and operator-specified trend sources when available.
3. Write one canonical `research/LITERATURE_GROUNDING.json` whose primary sources cover every material premise, nearest competitor, relevant foundation, contradictory result, and open frontier. Judge connected claim coverage rather than fixed paper counts; generate `LIT_MATRIX.tsv` with the literature-ledger tool.
7. Never copy paper or media prose. Store metadata, short paraphrased summaries, and original analysis.

## Training & inference infrastructure contract (research + plan stages)

If the project will involve gradient-based training or large-scale inference,
the agent must select an existing open-source framework on each axis
(training, inference) before the planning stage closes. Self-written
training loops, bare `model.generate()` benchmark loops, and hand-rolled
PPO/GRPO/RLHF trainers are **hard blockers** at the reviewer gate.

Frameworks are real, non-trivial repositories — not snippets, gists, or a
"starter template" the agent writes itself. Investigate infrastructure in the
plan stage after the idea survives de-risk. Clone and inspect the selected
framework plus any decision-critical runner-up; do not clone every search hit.

1. **Anchor against the bundled baseline:** read
   `argus_builtin_skills/training-infrastructure-guide.md` first. It is
   the operator-curated starting point covering LLM SFT/DPO/RLHF, agent
   RL, diffusion (T2I), LLM inference, and API inference.
2. **Search further only when needed** for method compatibility or an
   unresolved tradeoff. Reuse previously certified framework evidence when current.
3. **Clone and study before choosing.** For the selected framework and a
   decision-critical runner-up:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth=1 <repo-url> code/references/<repo-name>/
   git -C code/references/<repo-name>/ log -1 --format='%cI' > code/references/<repo-name>/.last-commit-iso
   ```
   then read at least the README, the top-level `examples/` or
   `scripts/` directory, and the trainer/inferencer entrypoint module
   so you understand how the framework is intended to be used.
3a. **Scan the README for supersession hints.** Frameworks routinely
    get upstreamed into a larger project or superseded; the original
    repo often still ranks in search but its README points elsewhere.
    Concrete example: `flow_grpo`'s own README now says it is "now
    supported by `verl-omni`". For every shortlisted repo run:
    ```bash
    grep -nEi 'now supported by|upstreamed (in)?to|merged (in)?to|moved to|migrated to|deprecat|archived|superseded|recommended|please use|maintained at' \
        code/references/<repo>/README* 2>/dev/null
    ```
    If any hit names a successor, clone the successor too, compare the
    two in the rationale, and **default to the successor** unless there
    is a concrete reason to stay on the older repo.
4. **Maintenance bar:** verify active maintenance and compatibility from current
   releases/issues/docs; do not use a fixed calendar cutoff.
5. **Paper-released frameworks are allowed** when maintained and the paper appears in
   `research/LITERATURE_GROUNDING.json`. Prefer the official authors'
   repo over third-party reimplementations.
6. **No self-written training or inference loops.** Wrap an existing
   framework. Excepted: thin glue scripts that import the framework's
   trainer/inferencer object and configure it.
7. **Plan stage artifact:** `research/INFRA_CHOICE.md` contains a short
   comparison and locks in
   exactly one training framework and exactly one inference framework
   with rationale tying the choice to the project domain and the
   GPU / API budget. Mirror the locked choice in
   `research/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md` under an `## Infra` section. Record
   one explicitly-rejected runner-up with a one-line reason.
8. **Skip the artifact only if** the project does not train any model
   AND does not run large-scale inference (e.g. a pure literature
   analysis paper). Record the skip explicitly in
   `research/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md`; otherwise the reviewer checks
   `plan.infra_choice`.

## Pipeline state machine and stage rollback

The project advances through the 8 stages in order
(research → plan → benchmark → run → analysis → draft → review → submission).
`research/PIPELINE_STATE.json` records `current_stage` and the per-stage
status. The L2 reviewer gates each transition by ticking off the
current stage's checklist items.

**Backward moves are not only allowed, they are required when an
upstream defect is discovered.** Examples:

- While in `run`, the reviewer notices the `benchmark` evaluator is a
  stub that returns a constant — the right move is to roll back to
  `benchmark` and rewire the real scorer, NOT to patch around it from
  inside `run`.
- While in `draft`, the reviewer notices that
  `research/INFRA_CHOICE.md` was never locked in — roll back to `plan`,
  lock the choice, then re-advance.
- While in `analysis`, the reviewer notices that
  `scored_rows.jsonl` rows all carry the same score — roll back to
  `benchmark` (evaluator authenticity) or `run` (matrix completeness),
  fix the upstream cause, then re-advance.

When the reviewer detects an upstream defect that cannot be repaired within
the current mission's scope, it must reply `replan_requested` (never
`continue`) and name the target stage plus concrete reason in `next_action`.
The Supervisor then hands control to the Manager, which must schedule a fresh
mission to run:

```python
from argus_skill.skills.stage_machine import rollback_stage
rollback_stage(
    ".",
    target_stage="<earlier-stage>",
    reason="<one-sentence reason quoting the missing/unreliable artifact>",
)
```

That helper updates `current_stage`, demotes any stages strictly after
the target back to `pending`, and appends an entry to
`rollback_history` inside `PIPELINE_STATE.json` so the journal carries
an audit trail. The next round will load the earlier stage's checklist
and the agent must work it before being allowed to re-advance.

Forward moves still require every item on the current stage's
checklist to be ticked off by the reviewer.

## Benchmark and experiment contract
1. Final long-paper evidence must come from existing real benchmarks, official benchmark datasets, or official task releases with real ground truth/evaluation. Do not create synthetic benchmarks, generated proxy tasks, hand-written gold graphs, or local pseudo-benchmarks for the main paper claim.
2. Final long-paper evidence must use unique semantic tasks/examples, not duplicated prompts, relabeling, suffixes, paraphrase inflation, or shuffled copies.
3. A pilot remains a pilot until its evidence supports the intended claim. A
   focused public benchmark may support a narrow claim; broader claims require
   broader public validation.
4. Use compute appropriate to the research question. Record claim-relevant model,
   system, data, environment, and cost details. GPU saturation is a throughput
   consideration, not a universal scientific gate.
5. A compact bag-of-words scorer, exact lookahead/oracle policy, lexical ranker, prompt-only wrapper, or trivial classifier is allowed only as a smoke test, baseline, ablation, or operator-approved non-frontier scope. It must not be presented as the main proposed method for a submission-quality long paper.
6. Benchmark construction is not execution. `benchmarks/full/tasks.jsonl`, benchmark manifests, or `status.json task_count` do not satisfy final evidence unless raw completed scored rows under `experiments/**` cover every required method/baseline condition.
7. Use appropriate executed public benchmark/data/task sources for final
   empirical claims. Provenance must record official source, version,
   license/access, split/filtering, evaluation unit, metric, claim tested, and
   execution status. No fixed source count is imposed.
8. Use local compute, hosted models, CPUs, accelerators, simulators, theorem
   provers, or other resources only when appropriate to the research design.
9. Synthetic/local tasks are smoke-only. They may test code paths, but their results must not appear in main paper tables, headline metrics, final claims, or submission-readiness artifacts.
10. Include the strongest relevant comparisons needed to interpret the claim; do
    not impose Agent-specific baseline sets on unrelated domains.
11. Do not optimize toward a validator-shaped row target. Evidence scale follows
    the claim and uncertainty method.
12. Include ablations, failure analysis, confidence intervals or statistical significance, and enough raw logs/results to reproduce every numerical claim.
13. Every long experiment must write `manifest.json`, `status.json`, `progress.jsonl`, logs, raw rows, and a STOP-file cancellation contract. `progress.jsonl` should expose current method, task count, total count, success/failure counts, last heartbeat, and latest artifact path so progress is visible while the daemon is running.
14. the L2 reviewer run-stage "full-scale evidence" checklist item before analysis/drafting; if it fails, write only pilot diagnostics and queue the missing full-run/matrix-completion work.

## Mandatory thick exemplar learning
1. Invoke the Paper Exemplar PDF Learning skill before drafting prose.
2. Download at least two open-access top-conference paper PDFs under `paper/style_ref/exemplars/<slug>/paper.pdf`.
3. At least one exemplar should be a recent strong/award paper from the selected
   venue when available; another should match the contribution/evidence structure.
4. Extract text to `paper/style_ref/exemplars/<slug>/paper.txt`, compute and record `pdf_sha256`, record license and `pdf_storage_policy`, and write `paper/style_ref/SOURCES.md`.
5. Before locking a primary exemplar, write `paper/style_ref/EXEMPLAR_SUITABILITY.json` scoring candidate exemplars against this project's task type, method family, experiment shape, figure/table density, related-work structure, and page rhythm. the L2 reviewer draft-stage exemplar checklist item; a weak exemplar match is a drafting blocker.
6. `paper/style_ref/EXEMPLAR.json` must use `exemplar_schema_version: 2` and include `local_pdf`, `text_extract`, `pdf_sha256`, `license`, `pdf_storage_policy`, `usage: "structural_style_only"`, and `no_prose_copy: true` for every exemplar.
7. Write a thick `paper/style_ref/STYLE_PROFILE.md` covering abstract shape, section/page allocation, figure/table inventory, related-work shape, evaluation layout, formatting/layout lessons, writing lessons, transfer plan, and no-prose-copy policy.
8. Write `paper/style_ref/PAPER_STRUCTURE_BLUEPRINT.md` before prose. It must map exemplar lessons to this paper's section order, page budget, paragraph roles, figure/table plan, related-work grouping, evaluation sequence, and local evidence mapping. Draft the paper by following this exemplar-derived skeleton directly; title and section names may adapt to the current thesis, but the page rhythm and role sequence should not drift without explicit evidence.
9. After drafting, write `paper/style_ref/STRUCTURE_CONFORMANCE.md` and `paper/style_ref/STRUCTURE_CONFORMANCE.json` from the actual `paper/main.tex` section order. The JSON must use `conformance_schema_version: 1`, `verdict: "PASS"`, `no_prose_copy_attestation: true`, at least two `exemplar_lessons`, and `section_mappings` for every final top-level section before References/Appendix.
10. Every section mapping must include `maps_to_exemplar_phase`, `evidence_sources`, `exemplar_lesson`, and a paper-specific `deviation_rationale` for nonstandard sections. The paper may adapt exemplar architecture to the current thesis, but unmapped/freehand filler sections such as `Protocol Notes`, `Track Mechanics`, `Release Detail`, `Mechanics`, or `Notes` are blockers.
11. Run `the L2 reviewer ticking off the draft-stage exemplar/structure checklist item`; URL-only exemplars and missing structure blueprints are blockers. Final readiness additionally checks `STRUCTURE_CONFORMANCE`.
12. Use exemplars only for structural style learning. Do not copy prose, examples, terminology, claims, bibliography text, figure design, or sentence templates.

## Paper narrative and prose contract
1. Do not write the abstract first. Draft the abstract after the main numbers, ablations, and limitations exist.
2. The paper must have one sentence-long contribution: "We propose X. We show X improves Y by Z because W." If X, Y, Z, and W cannot be filled from evidence, the paper is not ready.
3. The abstract should follow the selected venue's normal research-paper style:
   problem, gap, contribution, evidence, implication.
4. Every numerical paper claim must trace to raw artifacts under `results/`, `experiments/`, or `paper/artifacts/`.
5. Paper writing and experimentation may interleave. If drafting exposes weak or missing evidence, stop claiming readiness, run the needed supplement/ablation/error analysis, and then update the claim graph and paper; if the evidence remains weak, soften or remove the claim instead of cherry-picking.
6. Keep claims calibrated without turning the paper into repetitive defensive caveats. Move detailed scope limits to limitations/discussion.
7. Never invent BibTeX. Fetch/verify references through scholarly sources or mark unresolved entries as blockers.
8. The main Results section must present public evidence and strongest relevant
   comparisons clearly in a domain-appropriate table, figure, proof summary, or
   analysis. Do not force a three-benchmark matrix.

## Paper-quality contract files
1. `paper/CLAIM_GRAPH.json` must bind every major claim to its section, required evidence, raw result artifact, figure/table/citation support, and allowed fallback if evidence is weak. `paper/EVIDENCE_GAPS.json` must list missing or weak evidence and the planned supplement, ablation, negative result framing, or claim downgrade.
2. `paper/FIGURE_TABLE_STYLE_GUIDE.json` must specify the intended body/appendix float inventory, width, font/readability target, legend/caption length, color discipline, column density, information hierarchy, and whether each float belongs in the main body or appendix. Ugly, cramped, or audit-table-like floats are blockers even if the PDF compiles.
3. Repair missing evidence before structure, figure/table, format/layout, or language polish. Underlength, underfilled body, missing full-scale runs, missing baselines, weak ablations, or missing failure analysis are not layout-only problems: route them to additional experiments, ablations/failure studies, source-backed Introduction/Related Work/Method expansion, or evidence-backed analysis according to the actual gap. After repeated non-improving edits, reset the skeleton/float plan instead of looping on review JSON or cosmetic micro-edits.
5. the L2 reviewer analysis/draft-stage paper-quality checklist items before final academic-language and layout review. Missing, stale, or thin contract artifacts are hard blockers.

## Citation and related-work contract
1. Use starter citation targets only when the topic matches. Treat keys as retrieval targets, not as ready BibTeX: verify each entry through Semantic Scholar, arXiv, CrossRef, ACL Anthology, DBLP, or official project pages.
2. Keep references separated by claim/topic/section. Each related-work paragraph must cite the specific papers it discusses; do not dump all citations into one dense paragraph, one mega-sentence, a caption, or the bibliography with no local discussion.
3. Maintain a literature matrix with topic, paper key, verified source, claim supported, and intended paper section before drafting related work.
4. Use the selected venue's official bibliography and citation style. Do not
   override it with a different historical venue convention.
5. Verify references semantically, not only by compiling: citation key, title, authors, year, venue, DOI/arXiv/ACL URL, and rendered bibliography entry must refer to the same paper. Missing author/editor/organization metadata is a blocker because it renders title-only labels. If a starter key maps to an unrelated title, refetch the metadata instead of renaming the entry.
6. Starter targets for memory, agent-skill, and hallucination papers:
   - Tool-use and agent loops: `yao2023react`, `shinn2023reflexion`, `madaan2023selfrefine`, `schick2023toolformer`, `qin2023toolllm`, `li2023apibank`, `patil2023gorilla`, `shen2023hugginggpt`, `karpas2022mrkl`.
   - Memory, skills, and long-horizon agents: `wang2024voyager`, `zhao2024expel`, `packer2023memgpt`, `park2023generativeagents`, `xu2025amem`, `zhong2024memorybank`, `wang2023longmem`.
   - Self-evolution and process supervision: `qi2024webrl`, `li2025webevolver`, `wang2025mobileagente`, `tang2025sage`, `zhang2025skillrl`, `lightman2023letsverify`, `zelikman2022star`.
   - Evaluation, hallucination, and multi-agent surveys: `zheng2023judging`, `ji2023survey`, `huang2025hallucination`, `guo2024llmmas`, `manakul2023selfcheckgpt`, `lin2022truthfulqa`.
   - Agent benchmarks and validation environments: `liu2023agentbench`, `zhou2023webarena`, `mialon2023gaia`, `maharana2024locomo`, `shridhar2020alfworld`.
7. Add domain- and venue-relevant papers, benchmark/data papers, and official
   repos until the 35/30 bibliography-depth gate and claim coverage both hold.

## Paper formatting and layout contract
1. Use the selected venue's official style files and anonymous-review contract
   from `research/VENUE_PROFILE.json`.
2. Follow the selected venue's current page/word limits, section order,
   bibliography rules, and reproducibility requirements. Method/Experimental
   Setup must describe the actual research object and public evidence without
   assuming an agent/LLM architecture.
3. Use this reference page budget when writing `paper/PAGE_BUDGET.md` and `paper/style_ref/PAPER_STRUCTURE_BLUEPRINT.md`; adapt only with evidence/exemplar justification:

   | Section | Pages |
   | --- | --- |
   | Abstract | 0.3 |
   | Introduction | 1 |
   | Related Work | 0.5--0.8 |
   | Method | 1--1.5 |
   | Experimental Setup | 0.5--1 |
   | Main Results | 1--1.5 |
   | Analysis/Ablation | 1 |
   | Failure Cases | 0.3--0.5 |
   | Conclusion | 0.2 |

   Section-depth before final readiness is reviewer-calibrated, not an exact word-count floor. Keep the abstract in the normal 170--220 word range. The Introduction needs cited prior-work/benchmark hooks, problem/gap framing, method insight, quantified result preview, contribution roadmap, and scope; Method and Experimental Setup need enough evaluated-system, benchmark, metric, budget/decoding or scoring, seed-policy, and stopping-rule detail for a reviewer to understand the work. A body can be eight pages and still fail if it reaches the target through repeated caveats, formulaic contrast sentences, stale result numbers, oversized floats, or post-Conclusion material.

4. Conclusion must appear by the end of page 8 and should not render before page 7 for a full long paper. References and Appendix should begin on page 9 or later; references or appendix material on page 8 usually mean the paper has only about seven pages of body. If the body is short, add or move source-backed body content before Conclusion: literature-grounded Introduction/Related Work framing, benchmark/Method detail, or evidence-backed Results/Analysis/Ablation/Failure Cases content according to the page budget. Limitations, Ethical Considerations, release notes, references, or appendix content after Conclusion do not fix an underfilled main body. References must appear before Appendix and start cleanly after the eight-page body. Do not cap total pages after the reference/appendix boundary. Never put `\clearpage`, `\newpage`, `\pagebreak`, or `\FloatBarrier` immediately before Conclusion; use those only after body end matter when a clean bibliography/appendix boundary is needed.
5. the L2 reviewer review-stage checklist item for research.md format after final compile and before academic-language/layout review.
6. Write `paper/FORMAT_PREFLIGHT.md` with compile command/status, page count, conclusion page, figure/table inventory, bibliography status, fixes, and final preflight result.
7. No undefined references/citation warnings, no rendered `[?]`, no `Overfull \hbox > 5pt`, no placeholders/TODO/TBD/FIXME, no `% UNVERIFIED`, and no ugly code-like display labels in title, abstract, headings, captions, figures, or tables.
8. Body figures <=5 total, at most one `figure*`, every figure labeled and referenced, every table caption has a numerical headline, middle-body visual rhythm passes the model-backed layout review, and at least one paired-significance table when comparative binary outcomes apply.
9. The body should include a large main results matrix that covers all selected benchmark families and major baselines in one place; it should be visually professional rather than a dump of review artifacts. Split only if the table cannot fit cleanly under the overfull/legibility contract, and keep the cross-benchmark summary in the body while moving low-value diagnostics to the appendix.
10. Tables must follow the `research.md` style tokens: `\footnotesize`, `\tabcolsep=3-4pt`, `\arraystretch=1.15`, light-gray header, soft peach "ours" row, alternating row tint for long tables, coral accent only for meaningful degradation, and bold winning values.

## Figure contract
1. Use the research vertical's Research Visualization Router for every figure.
2. Optionally record renderer/source handoff metadata in `FIGURE_PROVENANCE.json`; it is not a completion gate.
3. Data figures and tables trace to canonical raw data/results. Deterministic SVG/HTML/React/diagram/PPT figures trace to editable source.
4. Image-2 is optional. When selected, preserve prompt, generation provenance, inspect/review artifacts, accepted raster SHA-256, width/height, and `IMAGE2_FIGURES.json`; never wrap a local file in image-2 metadata.
5. Conceptual figures must be adaptive/landscape and readable at final paper size regardless of renderer. Avoid cramped squares, weird/sketchy fonts, tiny text, heavy gradients, photorealism, excessive logos, or decorative clutter.

## Final paper review
1. Compile and read the current paper as a venue reviewer.
2. Open the raw result or primary source behind any material claim that remains
   doubtful.
3. Use language or layout review tools only for a concrete unresolved question;
   their generated files are advisory.
4. Let the L2 Reviewer decide readiness from the manuscript and sources. Do not
   write an assurance packet or optimize generated review scores.

## Operational safety
1. Work inside this project directory unless reading an operator-provided research playbook or the active Argus source/package through the launcher-provided environment.
2. Never copy parent workspaces, the Argus repository, `.skill-agent`, `.argus-skill`, `.cache`, model caches, capability vaults, or recursive workspaces into this project.
3. **Model weight storage:** if you download any model checkpoint, adapter, tokenizer, embedding, or dataset, put it under `./models/` inside this project. Set the HuggingFace / PyTorch cache environment to point there: `HF_HOME=$(pwd)/models/huggingface`, `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE=$(pwd)/models/huggingface/hub`, `HF_DATASETS_CACHE=$(pwd)/models/huggingface/datasets`, `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE=$(pwd)/models/huggingface/hub`, `TORCH_HOME=$(pwd)/models/torch`. Each project owns its weights; do not pollute the shared `~/.cache/` of the host or another project. Add `models/` to `.gitignore` if it is not already there so checkpoints never enter git history. Skip the download entirely if the model is already addressable through the model API route in `~/.argus-skill/capabilities/model_api.json`.
4. Keep API keys and capability vault contents out of all artifacts.
5. Record meaningful decisions and evidence in project files, not only in chat.
6. Preserve user edits and unrelated work. Do not revert files you did not intentionally change.

## Forbidden shortcuts
- Do not fake experiments, citations, provenance, tests, reviews, image-2 artifacts, or review outputs.
- Do not edit generated paper artifacts without updating the generator/source and manifest.
- Do not satisfy the reviewer by adding boilerplate that makes the actual paper worse.
- Do not copy a previous project and rename variables to make it look new.
- Do not silently ignore failed commands, missing artifacts, stale reviews, or checklist blockers.

## Completion contract
A task is complete only when:
- the requested paper artifact or blocker fix exists in source and regenerated artifacts,
- source, generated artifacts, manifests, reviews, and validation reports are synchronized,
- relevant validation has passed or remaining failures are explicitly unrelated to the task,
- known limitations are documented without pretending they are solved,
- the handoff states what changed, what passed, and the next highest-priority blocker.

The full project is complete only when the L2 reviewer certifies `done` for `scope: final_submission` against the full pipeline checklist on the current workspace, with every checklist item satisfied and backed by concrete evidence, and that verdict is quoted in completion evidence.

## Harness self-evolution
Reusable behavior belongs in a Skill. Checklist defects are reported in the
Reviewer verdict and repaired in the source vertical contract by a later scoped
task; the runtime has no `checklist_ops` mutation channel.

## Generality check
This template is venue-aware and project-neutral. It must not contain
host-specific Argus paths, a specific project title, benchmark name, result
number, figure name, or prior-workspace story.

## Coverage check
Before using the template, fill all bracketed placeholders, list allowed inputs, and delete no hard gate unless the operator explicitly changes the paper scope.
