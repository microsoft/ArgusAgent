"""Publishing a reviewed self-maintenance fix waits for the operator.

Policy decision (2026-07-26): the daemon used to push a branch and open a PR by
itself once a fix was independently reviewed, canaried and adopted locally —
`auto_merge=False`, but the branch and PR appeared without anyone asking. The
operator chose the stricter option: nothing leaves the machine until a human
approves it.

Everything before publication is deliberately unchanged. The fix is still
authored, reviewed, canaried and adopted, and `local_active` stays a complete
terminal state — the daemon keeps repairing itself, it just stops publishing on
its own.

The approval is bound to one reviewed commit and is single-use. A blanket
"publishing is allowed" flag would authorise whatever the NEXT self-maintenance
cycle produced, which is precisely the thing the operator asked to stop.
