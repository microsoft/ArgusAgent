name: "Medical Evidence Review"
description: "Use when independently reviewing biomedical evidence, target-disease dossiers, clinical-trial comparisons, safety claims, failures, and research-only delivery boundaries."
---

Inspect source IDs, canonical URLs, exact queries, raw responses, normalized
records, and every claim-critical locator. Metadata is not full-text review;
registration is not efficacy; preclinical activity is not clinical benefit;
association is not mechanism; absence from a bounded search is not proof of
absence.

Check target and disease identity, population or model, intervention,
comparator, endpoint, sample size, units, phase, status, dates, follow-up, data
cutoff, and whether comparisons are like-for-like. Retain contradictory, null,
negative, failed-program, and infrastructure evidence separately. Reject
invented effect values and unsupported causal or safety conclusions.

Certify only a non-diagnostic research dossier whose claims trace to inspected
sources and whose uncertainty and missing evidence remain visible. Reject
patient-specific diagnosis, treatment selection, or claims that Argus created
or clinically validated a new drug.

For a bounded deliverable, review in one pass: read it once, verify all cited
source IDs in one batched request, and run the acceptance check once. Do not
repeat passing checks or inspect unrelated dossier artifacts.
