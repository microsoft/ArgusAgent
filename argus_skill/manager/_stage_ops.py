"""argus.manager._stage_ops — mixin for stage-transition authority.

``_StageDecisionMixin`` carries the Manager's sole stage-transition authority
(``decide_stage_transition``) and the ``current_stage`` reader.

``decide_stage_transition`` is decomposed into focused private helpers grouped
by phase — gather context, run the model, parse the decision, apply to disk —
so that no method exceeds 350 lines while the full decision logic is preserved
byte-for-byte.
