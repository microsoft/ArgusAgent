    its offender (``significance_below_publishable:exploratory``). The one
    that fires most often was the one that said least.

    Testbed run 15 (``s-f0dbba19``) is what that costs. Six Reviewer rounds
    each emitted a ``RESEARCH_RESULT`` block and all six were discarded whole:
    the prompt listed the five field *names* and never their legal values, so
    the model supplied fluent inventions — ``result_class=proof``,
    ``correctness_status=proved``, ``significance_status=bounded_complete``,
    ``statement_fidelity_status=supported``. The operator was then told the
    research result was missing, against a reviewer message that visibly
    contained one, and the project could not close at its final stage.

    The prompt now renders ``RESULT_FIELD_CHOICES``, which is the actual fix.
    This is the second line: when a value still misses, the trace says which
    field and which value rather than leaving an operator to diff two enums by
    eye.

#: Which significance ratings clear each research target.
#:

#: with two names. That is what ``publishable`` and ``doctoral`` were for every
#: result class except surveys: the survey branch below has always indexed the
#: accepted set by target, while the original-result branch asked only for
#: ``significance in {publishable, doctoral}`` regardless of which of the two
#: was requested — so an operator who asked for doctoral work and received a
#: result its own author graded ``publishable`` got a completion. The distinction
#: survived in the vocabulary, in the prompts that ask a Reviewer to grade
#: against it, and in the operator's expectation; it did not survive in the
#: check. One table, read by both branches, is the whole fix.
#:
#: Monotone by construction: a higher rating always clears a lower target, so
#: nothing is refused for being too good.
