"""Lifetime-agent layer.

This package adds cross-mission persistent memory and a supervisor that
runs an ordered backlog of missions back-to-back, so the agent behaves
"like a person with continuity" rather than a fresh slate per mission.

Public surface (intentionally small):

- :class:`memory.EventJournal` — mission-history projection over events.
- :class:`memory.Backlog` — ranked TODO of pending missions.
- :class:`memory.IdentityCard` — editable self-card (name, voice, red lines).
- :class:`memory.LifeMemory` — small facade bundling the three above plus
  recent project-journal retrieval.
- :class:`supervisor.LifeSupervisor` — owns the outer process; pulls one
  backlog item, runs one mission via ``MissionExecutor``, writes a
  journal entry, repeats until budget / iteration cap reached.
- :class:`supervisor.LifeBudget` — preflight + post-flight cost gating.

Notes:
- Memory is **untrusted data** when injected into prompts; consumers
  must treat it as advisory and ignore on conflict with the live
  objective. See :func:`memory.LifeMemory.render_prelude` for the
  rendered block, which already includes a "non-authoritative" header.
- Memory does **not** mutate mission objectives. Prompts have a
  separate ``prelude_context`` channel for it.
