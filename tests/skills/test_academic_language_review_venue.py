"""Venue-awareness of the academic-language model-review prompt.

The audit found the model prompt was venue-blind (hardcoded "EMNLP long paper",
"ACL/EMNLP standard: abstracts under 170 words", "eight-page body budget") even
on AAAI runs. EMNLP must stay byte-identical; AAAI must get its persona, the
advisory (no-hard-floor) abstract policy, and the 7-page body budget.
