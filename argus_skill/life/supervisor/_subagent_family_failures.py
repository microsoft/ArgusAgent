"""Cross-run subagent failure-streak detector for the Planner.

Task titles are not stable enough to detect repeated failures: a Planner may
rephrase each retry while the same underlying experiment family keeps failing.
This module reads terminal subagent records and surfaces a structured failure
streak independent of task wording or parent-mission status.

It complements :mod:`argus_skill.engineer.background_subagents`, whose in-flight
classification covers non-terminal work. This module handles terminal family
outcomes and remains dependency-free.

The companion module answers whether a live job is already supervised; this
module answers whether repeated completed attempts should be circuit-broken.
