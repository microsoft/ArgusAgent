"""fiction_writing routing: the Manager can select it, it is presented to the
Manager as DISTINCT from a research 'literature review', and it round-trips
through persist/resolve. The Manager's LLM judgment is mocked (fake runner);
its live discrimination is a P3 eval — here we prove the plumbing + the menu
disambiguation deterministically."""
