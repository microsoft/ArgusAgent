"""What one mission needs to know about one claim, and nothing else.

A mathematics project accumulates state that no agent can be handed whole: a
few hundred claim versions, every verdict ever recorded against them, and the
routes that were tried and abandoned. Handing an Engineer the state file, or
the event log, or a summary of "the project so far", fails in both directions
at once — it is too long to read and it still does not say which of those
claims this particular task is about.

So this projects. Given the backlog item the supervisor just claimed, it finds
the claim that item is about and renders that claim's *neighbourhood*: the
statement and its version, the definitions it is stated against, the external
results it is still taking on faith and whether anyone has yet been to the
sources they cite, the evidence that binds to this exact statement, the
immediate proof obligations, the routes already retired, and what would have to
happen for its status to move. Nothing transitive, and nothing about any other
claim.

Three properties are load-bearing, and each has a test that fails when it stops
holding:

**Bounded by the claim, not by the project.** Only depth-1 dependencies appear.
A second hop would pull in the obligations' obligations, and in a project with a
real proof tree that is the whole tree — which is the thing this module exists
not to send. One hop is also what a single mission can act on: it is the set of
statements whose status could change as a result of this round. That rule alone
is not a bound, though — one claim can carry a hundred cited theorems — so
every list rendered below is additionally capped by ``_MAX_ROWS`` and says how
many rows it withheld.

**Deterministic.** The same store and the same mission render byte-identical
text. No timestamps, no host paths, no reliance on ``dict`` order. The fragment
carries a digest of its own content so two of them can be told apart without
diffing prose — and so a reader who sees the same digest twice knows nothing
moved, rather than assuming it.

**It never raises into a mission.** A missing store means "this project does no
recorded mathematics" and produces nothing at all; a store that will not load
produces a block that says so; a defect in *this code* produces a block that
says that instead, and says the recorded state is intact. The three are kept
apart because they need opposite responses, and the wrong one is expensive: an
empty fragment from a broken file would tell the Engineer that a project with a
hundred recorded proofs believes nothing, and a "repair the file" instruction
aimed at a projector bug points an autonomous agent at a healthy
``MATH_STATE.json``.

This module is an adapter and lives on the vertical side deliberately.
``argus_skill/proof_ledger/`` imports nothing from Argus so it can be lifted
out; a projector that reads ``BacklogItem`` is exactly the Argus-shaped code
that would stop it.

_STATE_REF = "/".join(STATE_RELPATH)

#: The mission fields consulted for the target claim, most decisive first.
#:
#: These are the three model-authored prose fields that exist on *both* intake
#: paths. The flat Planner path fills ``TASK_TITLE``, ``TASK_OBJECTIVE``,
#: ``TASK_ACCEPTANCE_CHECK`` and ``TASK_NON_GOALS`` and says outright that the
#: host owns everything else. The Manager's bounded-DAG path carries more than
#: that: ``manager/dispatch.py`` builds a ``BacklogItem`` straight from a
#: model-authored ``BoundedDagNode``, so ``node_key``, ``context_refs`` (which
#: do survive on that path), ``plan_hypothesis``, ``goal_contribution`` and
#: ``expected_regressions`` are model-authored there too.
#:
#: This tuple is therefore a choice, not an exhaustive inventory of what a
#: model can write -- do not extend it on the belief that nothing else could
#: carry a claim id, and do not assume adding a field to ``BoundedDagNode``
#: leaves the set complete. ``plan_hypothesis`` is the closest call and is left
#: out deliberately: it is prose about *why* a step should work, which tends to
#: name every claim in the neighbourhood, so scanning it would widen the
#: ambiguity surface (see ``resolve_target``) for very little reach.
#:
#: ``non_goals`` is absent for a different reason: a claim named there is the
#: one the mission was told *not* to work on, and projecting it would aim the
#: whole fragment at the excluded statement.
MISSION_TARGET_FIELDS = ("acceptance_check", "title", "objective")

#: Characters that unambiguously continue an identifier. Used as a boundary so
#: that a claim called ``lemma-a`` is not found inside ``lemma-a-prime``: ids in
#: this schema are chosen by whoever recorded the claim, and prefix
#: relationships between them are the normal case rather than a strange one.
_ID_CORE = r"[A-Za-z0-9_\-]"

#: ``.`` is the hard case and needs its own rule. It is a legitimate id
#: character (``thm.3.1``), so treating it as a boundary would find ``thm.3``
#: inside ``thm.3.1``. But it is also how English ends a sentence, and an
#: acceptance check that reads "Prove udist-main." is the ordinary way a
#: mission names its claim -- treating it as an id character there makes the
#: single most common phrasing invisible. So a dot continues an id only when
#: something else follows it that continues an id too.
_LEFT = rf"(?<!{_ID_CORE})(?<!{_ID_CORE}\.)"
_RIGHT = rf"(?!{_ID_CORE})(?!\.{_ID_CORE})"

#: One statement, clipped. A claim statement is written by an agent and is
#: claim-sized by nature; this is a backstop against a pasted proof, not a
#: summarization policy, so it is generous and marked when it fires.
_MAX_TEXT = 600

#: A shorter clip for text that appears once per neighbour rather than once per
#: fragment.
_MAX_NEIGHBOUR_TEXT = 220

#: Rows per list. Every list rendered below goes through ``_rows``: the
#: neighbourhood rule bounds most of them by construction, but "bounded by the
#: claim" is not the same as "bounded", and a single claim carrying 120 cited
#: theorems is exactly the pathology this is here for. A list that is capped
#: reports what it withheld rather than truncating in silence.
