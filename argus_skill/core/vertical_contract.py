        ``mission`` is the claimed backlog item. Without it every mission in a
        stage receives a byte-identical block, so a vertical can only say
        things about the stage -- which is the same as saying them once in a
        role banner. It is what lets a vertical answer "what does this
        particular task need to know".

        Forwarded by keyword, not positionally, which makes the parameter
        *names* part of the contract. The alternative -- appending ``mission``
        positionally, so a three-argument provider fails on arity instead --
        was considered and rejected: positional forwarding lets a provider that
        merely *reorders* its parameters take ``stage`` where it meant
        ``project_root``, silently, both being plausible strings, and that is a
        wrong answer rather than a failure. Keyword forwarding closes it.

        Be clear about what the price of that is, because it is steeper than
        "an error message". This hook is called unguarded from
        ``life/supervisor/_mission_execution_runtime.py``; a ``TypeError``
        here propagates through ``_run_one`` and ``tick`` to ``run``, which
        fails the item, emits ``life.supervisor.error``, sets ``stopped_by =
        "supervisor_error"`` and **breaks the run loop**. So a stale
        out-of-tree provider does not degrade a project, it halts it, on every
        restart, from the first mission. That is still the better trade than
        the alternatives -- the failure is immediate, deterministic, and its
        message names the argument to add, whereas a vertical quietly demoted
        to stage-blind emits nothing at all and stays wrong for the life of the
        project -- but a reader weighing a change here should weigh the real
        cost, not a rhetorical one.

        This is deliberately *not* softened by inspecting the provider's
        signature and only passing ``mission`` when it is accepted. That would
        keep stale providers running at the price of making them permanently
        and invisibly stage-blind, which is the failure mode with no error
        message and no end.

        One inconsistency to know about, pre-existing and left alone: a
        provider that returns a non-``str`` is dropped silently by the last
        line here, while one that raises takes the run down. Two malformed
        providers, two opposite blast radii.
