"""Shared typed state for the ``SupervisedEngineer.run`` round loop.

``runner.py`` splits the round loop into cohesive phase mixins (prompt
assembly, engineer-turn execution, background/external waits, reviewer
invocation, and round settlement). These phases need two kinds of shared
state:

* ``RoundLoopState`` — mutable state that genuinely crosses round
  boundaries (streaks, the last reviewer ``next_action``, etc). It is
  constructed once per ``run()`` call and mutated in place by each phase;
  ``SupervisedEngineer`` itself stays stateless across calls (see its
  class docstring), so this must never become an instance attribute.
* ``EngineerTurnOutcome`` — the parsed result of a single engineer turn,
  threaded from the execution phase into the later phases of the SAME
  round.
* ``RoundControl`` — a tiny sentinel the phase methods return to tell the
  driving ``for`` loop in ``run()`` whether to return a terminal result,
  ``continue`` to the next round immediately, or fall through and let the
  loop body finish normally. This mirrors the original in-line
  ``return``/``continue`` control flow exactly; nothing about mission
  semantics changes.
