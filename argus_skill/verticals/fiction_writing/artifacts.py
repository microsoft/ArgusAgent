"""fiction_writing artifact lineage: bind the shared artifact-manifest contract
to fiction's own artifact VOCABULARY and canonical production chain.

The fiction end of the Artifact-Manifest closed loop. A fiction mission produces
a fixed chain of artifacts across its six stages; :func:`build_fiction_manifest`
is the reference PRODUCER of that chain (with correct parents, producer_stage,
content paths, and supersede/version bookkeeping), exactly as the runtime
engineer must record it in ``fiction/artifact_manifest.json``. The shared
contract then validates whatever is on disk, and :mod:`.manifest_check` gates the
revise stage on it.

The canonical chain and its lineage:

    creative_brief ─┬─ story_plan ─┬─ chapter_goal
                    └─ style_profile │
                                     ▼
                                   draft ──┬─ state_patch ─ story_state ─ review
                                           │                                 │
                                           │                          revision_plan
                                           ▼                                 │
                                  final (supersedes draft) ◄─────────────────┘
                                           │
                            updated_story_state (supersedes story_state)

So ``final.md`` traces back to both the ``draft`` it revised and the ``review``
that drove it, and each replaced artifact (draft, story_state) is explicitly
``superseded`` — never silently overwritten.
