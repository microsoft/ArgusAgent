# Auto Research Pipeline

## Purpose

Run a complete AI research project as a gated, evidence-first workflow. This
pipeline is domain-neutral: agent/LLM research is one possible use case, not the
default shape.

Valid contribution shapes include:

- a new method, architecture, algorithm, objective, or system;
- theory or a formally supported mechanism;
- interpretability or causal analysis;
- a diagnostic, characterization, taxonomy, evaluation, or benchmark/data
  contribution;
- a rigorous negative or boundary result only when it yields a surprising,
  robust, independently useful insight rather than merely documenting failure;
- a reproducible systems or efficiency finding.

The acceptance question is whether the work has a strong thesis and evidence
appropriate to it. Positive metrics are not mandatory, but a completed
experiment or honest failure report is not automatically a paper.

## Non-negotiable research bar

- Ground the question in primary literature, official artifacts, and the
  strongest relevant prior work.
- State one clear thesis or research question and the result that would support,
  weaken, or refute it.
- Preserve negative, contradictory, and failed evidence in the internal audit
  trail. Paper selection remains a scientific judgment.
- Do not manufacture novelty, benchmarks, labels, results, citations, or
  provenance.
- Final empirical evidence must include at least one appropriate public
  benchmark, dataset, task suite, challenge, or official evaluation release.
- Synthetic/generated data may be used for smoke tests, controlled diagnostics,
  mechanism isolation, stress tests, and ablations, but must not be the sole
  final empirical evidence or be presented as a public benchmark.
- Evidence breadth and scale follow the claim. There is no universal benchmark
  count, task count, model count, seed count, effect-size threshold, or
  wall-clock cutoff.

## Venue selection

If the operator explicitly names a venue, use that venue and verify the current
cycle and official author kit.

If the venue is unspecified:

1. Use live web search at runtime.
2. Identify CCF-A conferences relevant to the paper's actual AI subfield whose
   main/research-track submission deadline has not passed at the current UTC
   time.
3. Verify CCF classification, scope, exact deadline/time zone, and official
   author kit from primary sources.
4. Write `research/VENUE_SELECTION.md` with candidates, sources, deadline
   status, scope fit, selection, and rejection reasons.
5. Set the descriptive `target_venue` field and write
   `research/VENUE_PROFILE.json`.

Never silently default to EMNLP, AAAI, or any closed conference. Venue-dependent
draft/review/submission work remains blocked until a current profile exists.

## Resource policy

- Discover available compute, APIs, data access, and time budget through the
  supported runtime helpers and project state; do not read or print raw secrets.
- Choose resources that answer the question faithfully. GPU availability does
  not require training a large model.
- Prefer maintained frameworks for standard work. Custom trainers, evaluators,
  runtimes, kernels, cache policies, or distributed mechanisms are allowed when
  they are part of or necessary for the contribution; justify and validate them
  against a trusted reference.
- Long jobs may use the supervised subagent system, a scheduler, or the
  project's native runner. Parallelism is optional and bounded by real
  resources.

## Pipeline state contract

`research/PIPELINE_STATE.json` is the mission ledger. The Engineer may update
descriptive fields such as objective, target venue, and artifact paths. Stage
fields (`current_stage` and per-stage statuses) are Manager-owned.

The canonical stage order is:

```text
research → plan → benchmark → run → analysis → draft → review → submission
```

## Artifact consistency

From analysis onward:

- keep canonical raw evidence separate from generated reports;
- generate tables, figures, and manuscript numbers from canonical sources;
- maintain `paper/ARTIFACT_MANIFEST.json` with paths, hashes, schemas, and source
  links;
- refresh downstream artifacts after source changes;
- never hand-edit generated review artifacts or success labels;
- keep exact local commands and paths in manifests/logs rather than rendered
  manuscript prose.

## Final research-paper contract

A project may finish with a paper only when:

- the research question is important and literature-grounded;
- the result is falsifiable and supported by authentic evidence;
- empirical claims include appropriate public benchmark/data evidence;
- the strongest relevant comparisons and confounds are handled fairly;
- uncertainty and repeatability are appropriate to the data-generating process;
- claims are scoped to what was actually measured or proved;
- the paper has one coherent, venue-relevant thesis and a clear strongest accept
  argument;
- a method paper's implementation has received a fair, competitive engineering
  effort before scientific failure is inferred;
- negative or boundary evidence is the paper's contribution only when its
  insight stands independently of the failed implementation;
- bibliography coverage is claim-complete and verified, without a universal
  entry count;
- the paper follows the selected venue's current official template and rules;
- citations, figures, tables, reviews, and submission artifacts are current;
- the L2 Reviewer certifies the full pipeline checklist.

A method losing to a baseline triggers implementation and research diagnosis,
not automatic write-up. Preserve the result; optimize, repair, or pivot according
to the diagnosed cause and expected information gain. Draft only after Reviewer
certifies an independently defensible publication thesis.

## Research figure contract

- Use the research vertical's Research Visualization Router for every figure.
- Renderer choice belongs to the Engineer and Reviewer, grounded in the figure
  brief, scientific semantics, editability, and actually available capabilities.
- Optionally record source/renderer handoff metadata in
  `paper/figures/FIGURE_PROVENANCE.json`; it is not a completion gate.
- Image-2 is one optional renderer. When selected, retain its canonical prompt,
  raw sidecars, accepted raster, review, and `IMAGE2_FIGURES.json`; when
  unavailable, use a truthful deterministic route rather than fabricating
  image-2 metadata or blocking the paper solely on the API.
- Reviewer uses a good-enough visual standard. Do not repeat figure regeneration
  for minor aesthetic preferences once the figure is readable, coherent, and
  attractive enough.
- When the router selects image-2, generate/review its required candidate set,
  register through `sync-paper-metadata`, reuse a valid frozen cache, and preserve
  exact accepted raster bytes. These image-2-specific rules do not apply to
  deterministic SVG/HTML/diagram/PPT renderers, which repair their own source and
  re-render.

## Stage guidance

### 1. Research

- Build `research/LITERATURE_GROUNDING.json` around claim coverage: nearest
  competitors, foundations, contradictions, negative evidence, and open
  frontier.
- Write `research/RESEARCH_BRIEF.md` and preserve rejected ideas with their real
  observations in the existing project history.
- Run the cheapest faithful falsification or characterization probe of the
  binding premise.
- Store the probe without a routing verdict; the Planner decides what it changes.

### 2. Plan

- Write `research/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md`.
- Define hypotheses/questions, strongest relevant comparisons, public evidence
  sources, metrics or proof obligations, controls/ablations, uncertainty method,
  budget, and stopping criteria.
- Select infrastructure after the idea survives de-risk.
- Do not impose fixed benchmark, baseline, task, or duration counts.

### 3. Benchmark

- Select and prepare appropriate public benchmarks/data/task suites.
- Record official source, version, split, license/access, evaluation unit,
  metric/evaluator, filtering, and claim tested.
- Synthetic diagnostics remain separate and supplementary.
- Run a faithful smoke test through the real evaluator or analysis path.

### 4. Run

- Execute via `Research Experiment Runner`.
- Preserve manifests, raw evidence, logs, status/progress for long jobs, and
  cancellation state.
- Run every claim-relevant condition or record an evidence-backed exclusion.
- Classify outcomes as supported positive, supported negative, supported
  boundary, misconfigured, inconclusive, or infeasible under budget.
- Underperformance must receive an implementation-adequacy audit and credible
  targeted optimization when justified; no fixed retry count substitutes for
  scientific judgment.

### 5. Analysis

- Regenerate all aggregates from raw artifacts.
- Map claims to evidence.
- Keep claim-critical losing, null, and contradictory comparisons visible in the
  evidence record and paper. Keep secondary dead ends in audit artifacts or an
  appendix instead of dumping every run into the main story.
- Select one defensible thesis before drafting. If no strong thesis survives,
  return to research/plan.
- Produce the required data and conceptual figures through the Research
  Visualization Router; image-2 is conditional on capability and renderer choice.

### 6. Draft

- Use the selected `research/VENUE_PROFILE.json` and official author kit.
- Write the paper around one supported insight. Do not introduce a method as the
  contribution and then center the manuscript on why it failed.
- Do not pad to a historical EMNLP/AAAI shape.

### 7. Review

- Run venue-aware academic-language, infrastructure-leak, layout, citation, and
  claim-evidence reviews.
- Fix source artifacts and rerun the owning review; never hand-edit PASS state.

### 8. Submission

- Verify the selected venue deadline/profile is current and the package obeys
  its official rules.
- Ask the L2 Reviewer to read the current paper and claim-critical sources
  directly before declaring completion. Do not build an assurance packet.

## Response shape

- State current stage and the strongest supported research conclusion.
- Name changed artifacts and decisive evidence.
- Report positive, negative, and inconclusive findings without spin.
- If blocked, state the exact missing external condition or evidence.
