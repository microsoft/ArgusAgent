"""One mission, one claim's neighbourhood, and nothing else in the prompt.

A mathematics project's recorded state is the wrong shape to hand an agent.
It grows without bound, most of it is about claims this task is not working
on, and the part that matters — what is still taken on faith, what evidence
binds to the statement *as it now reads*, which routes are already dead — is
buried in it. Pasting the file in is unreadable; pasting a summary of "the
project so far" is unreadable and still does not say which claim this task is
about.

The projection exists to answer that second question first, and the tests
below are organised around the four properties that make it safe to put its
output into an Engineer's prompt:

* **Targeting.** The claim is found in the mission's own text, most-decisive
  field first. Naming nothing is fine and yields nothing; naming two claims is
  refused rather than guessed at, because a fragment aimed at the wrong
  theorem is internally consistent and therefore invisible.
* **Boundedness.** What appears is a function of the claim, not of the
  project. A project that grew by forty claims renders the same bytes.
* **Determinism.** Same store, same mission, same bytes — no timestamps, no
  host paths, no dict-order dependence — so an unchanged digest really does
  mean nothing moved.
* **Degrading honestly.** No recorded mathematics means no fragment. A store
  that cannot be read means a fragment that *says so*, because silence there
  would tell the Engineer that a project holding a hundred proofs believes
  nothing.

The adversarial cases are cheap to build and would be expensive to notice: a
claim id that is a prefix of another id, a lemma named only in the non-goals,
evidence left over from a previous version of the statement.
