"""Tests for the nanochat 'search altitude' fact surfacer + its vertical hook.

The block is PURE VISIBILITY (no verdict): it re-surfaces the agent's own
recorded per-attempt ``mean_val_bpb`` so the planner/reviewer can judge
saturation. These tests pin the facts it computes (floor / distance /
consecutive-non-improving / recombined-token hint) and the fail-soft contract.
