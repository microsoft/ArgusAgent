"""Regression test: a targeted math project cannot complete with its goal open.

``math_objective_mode="targeted"`` means one named goal G: prove it or refute
it. Nothing in the deterministic completion path asked whether G was closed.

``stage_completion_issues`` read the objective mode only to decide whether
``research/PROOF_GRAPH.json` had to exist, then ran ``graph.validate()`` —
which is purely structural (status vocabulary, unknown ids, cycles,
proved-without-reviewer_confirmed). ``ProofGraph.gap()``, the one function that
answers "what does G still rest on", had exactly one caller in the tree: the
standalone operator CLI ``proof_graph_check``.

Downstream is no help. ``_review_certifies_completion`` checks reviewer status
plus ``research_completion_issue``, which is keyed on the research *strength*
axis (result_class / novelty / significance vs the target level) and discards
``vertical`` and ``mission_scope`` outright. The two persisted axes — objective
mode and research target level — were never intersected with each other, and
neither was intersected with the proof-graph gap.

So a targeted project whose root node was ``status="open"`` reached
``decision=complete``, ``complete_final_stage`` stamped a valid contract
fingerprint, and ``vertical_completion_certificate_status`` returned
``{"ok": true}`` — with the named goal still open on disk. Raising the research
target to ``doctoral`` did not close it: a genuine ``new_theorem`` about a side
lemma completes identically.

The only thing standing in the way was the reviewer skill prose, and the
reviewer is never told the persisted ``math_goal`` or the gap — and the failure
scenario is by construction one where its verdict is ``done``.
