"""A busy workdir should tell the operator what to do about it.

Seen while testing on 2026-07-26: launching a second daemon in a directory that
already had one printed

    argus-skill: workdir /tmp/argus-test/workdir is already leased:
    {"life_dir": "...", "pid": 4242, "sid": "s-holder", "workdir": "..."}

Everything the operator needed was in that line and none of it was actionable —
a raw lease record with a pid buried in it and no next step.
