"""Software-engineering vertical; Manager independently chooses execution mode.

The delivery checklist is the Reviewer's certification contract. It exists
because a Reviewer that only reads the Engineer's self-report cannot detect the
most common and most expensive software failure: code that does not build.

The Engineer only ever runs the tests it can see. When a benchmark, a CI job, or
a teammate later compiles the change against assertions the Engineer never had,
a name or signature that was never reconciled turns into a hard build error and
every test in the package fails at once. Certifying "it compiles, and the tests
I ran actually ran" is cheap -- seconds -- and catches that class outright, so
it is a protected floor item rather than advisory guidance.
