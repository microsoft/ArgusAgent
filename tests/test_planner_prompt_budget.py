# Raised from 9_500 / 15_000 when the math vertical gained the objective mode
# (targeted vs exploratory), the route ledger, and the proof-gap graph — three
# blocks the planner has to see to choose a next step, deliberately added
# rather than prose creep. The existing text was compressed first: the opening,
# the failed-attempt paragraph, and the closing options list are all shorter
# than they were. Compress again before raising these further.
#
# Raised again from 9_700 / 15_400 for two blocks the testbed runs paid for,
# both about work the planner can only place in `scope`:
#   * settle known results before dispatch — several workers on one goal cannot
#     see each other's searches, so a lookup done in `scope` costs once and the
#     same lookup done in `solve` costs once per worker; finding nothing is
#     recorded as a result too;
#   * two genuinely different attacks are two routes, an OR, and the test of
#     "different" is that they fail for different reasons — two routes dying to
#     the same obstruction were one route.
# Neither restates existing text. Compress before raising a third time.
# Raised by 50 to let the decision example carry a real question and a real
# objective. It used to hold placeholders, and the Planner copied them
# through: every campaign shipped a mission literally titled "title", then
# — after those were replaced with angle-bracket slots — one titled
# "<question>". An example a model can paste verbatim without producing
# nonsense is worth fifty characters of fixed policy.
