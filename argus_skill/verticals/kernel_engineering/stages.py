"""General GPU-kernel engineering vertical.

This vertical is for real repository work: diagnose and improve CUDA/Triton/
TileLang/CUTLASS/PyTorch kernels, preserve the public API, validate numerical
behavior, benchmark on the target accelerator, and prepare an upstream-quality
change.  ``kernelbench`` remains the fixed SOL-ExecBench competition vertical;
this package owns production/library kernel work where environment provenance
and integration quality matter as much as a latency number.
