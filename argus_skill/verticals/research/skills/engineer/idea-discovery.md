# Idea Discovery — find a real gap, don't invent one

> Adapted from ARIS `idea-discovery` skill (MIT, © 2026 wanshuiyin).

Strong papers come from finding a **real gap or unresolved question** grounded
in the literature, not from imagining contributions top-down. A useful method,
system, theorem, benchmark, diagnosis, characterization, negative result, or
boundary finding may close that gap.

## When to invoke

- Project is in the `research` stage and has only a broad direction
  (e.g. "improve LLM reasoning")
- Engineer needs IDEA_CANDIDATES.md before plan stage
- Previous idea was killed by `kill-argument` and the project needs to pivot

## Workflow

### Step 0 — fan out before a broad paper direction chooses a thesis

For a `publishable` or `doctoral` paper mission that starts from a broad
direction rather than an operator-locked hypothesis, use `agent-team-lead` to
form a 12-route streaming idea pipeline:

1. First inventory existing independent route reports. Count every report that
   already has a distinct mechanism, source trail, closest work, kill argument,
   and faithful probe; spawn only the missing routes. Never restart a second
   "broad search" merely because the directory or route names differ.
2. Give each route a materially different mechanism/domain slice, its own
   `research/ideation/routes/<route-id>.md` output, and a separately checkable
   source trail. Each route must identify the closest work, a non-obvious gap,
   the strongest kill argument, and a faithful public-benchmark or real-trace
   probe. Briefly inspect both application-frontier evidence
   (ACL/EMNLP/NAACL, ICLR/ICML/NeurIPS, AAAI/AAMAS, recent arXiv) and relevant
   mathematical, physical, statistical, ML, or deep-learning foundations.
   This is a soft coverage diagnostic, not a quota: explain a missing side and
   continue rather than spending tokens to fill categories.
   For a broad publishable/doctoral Agent paper, reserve at least four routes for
   independent foundation-first searches across relevant areas such as
   probability and learning theory, information theory, control and dynamical
   systems, causal inference, game theory, formal methods, or network/statistical
   physics. Each such route must start from a concrete Agent failure and derive
   an algorithm, bound, impossibility result, scaling law, threshold, or
   quantitative prediction. A borrowed analogy or renamed physical quantity is
   not a foundation.
3. Form all missing tasks, then set the team pool with
   `pool-set --root <team_root> --width 12 --state running`. The lead continues
   venue and source verification while the Curator supervises the portfolio.
4. As soon as one route report lands, give it to a fresh independent reviewer.
   The reviewer verifies primary sources, attacks prior art and ambition, and
   emits `qualified` or `rejected` plus the cheapest faithful probe contract.
   Judge primarily from theoretical depth, novelty, mechanism, and professional
   plausibility. Missing implementation detail or uncertain early evidence is
   not a rejection reason. Keep reviews streaming while the remaining routes
   continue.
5. Search primary papers and official artifacts for novelty. Also inspect
   credible practitioner reports, technical blogs, benchmark issue trackers,
   and incident reports when they reveal deployment failures or unmet needs;
   these may motivate a gap but never replace primary evidence for a novelty
   claim.
6. Preserve every route report and failed route. A single model call, several
   parallel search queries inside one context, or twelve variants of one
   mechanism do not satisfy the portfolio.

If provider capacity cannot sustain width 12, remain in research and surface
the capacity blocker. Do not silently collapse the portfolio into a single
author's candidate list.

### Step 1 — bound the direction

Engineer provides 1–2 sentence broad direction. Convert into 3–5
specific **trend-search queries** (NOT "improve LLM reasoning" but
"recent test-time compute results", "self-consistency vs sampling
diversity", etc.).

### Step 2 — multi-source literature scan

For each query, search **at least 3** of:
- arXiv (latest 12 months, filtered by ML/CL/AI)
- Semantic Scholar (citation-graph traversal from a recent strong paper)
- OpenAlex (cross-discipline coverage)
- ACL Anthology / OpenReview (venue-specific)
- HF Daily Papers (community-curated signal)

Pull abstracts + 1-paragraph TLDR for the top 30 hits per query.

### Step 3 — cluster + identify valuable open questions

Reviewer agent (gpt-5.5 via `author` route) reads the abstracts and
returns clusters of the form:

```
CLUSTER C-1: "Self-consistency helps math but hurts code generation"
  measured by: [Paper A, Paper B]
  current best / baseline: [the strongest reported method + its score]
  the gap: no method reliably keeps the math gain WITHOUT the code loss
  → research opening: <method, system, theory, diagnostic, evaluation, data,
    negative, or boundary contribution that resolves the question>
```

The reviewer ranks clusters by:
- **Stake** — "if resolved, X changes understanding or practice"
- **Research value** — would resolving this question change understanding,
  evaluation, system design, or practice?
- **Technical depth** — does the contribution require a nontrivial algorithm,
  system mechanism, formal object, or causal explanation rather than a prompt,
  schema, wrapper, or larger sweep?
- **Theoretical foundation** — are the objects, assumptions, invariants, and
  predicted consequences explicit enough to derive or falsify? Prefer
  load-bearing mathematics that determines the mechanism or predicts a bound,
  threshold, scaling law, or failure regime. A physical model must map Agent
  variables and interactions to measurable quantities and yield a distinct
  prediction; decorative equations or analogy do not add depth.
- **Feasibility** — is there a credible staged execution plan within the
  operator's resources and time budget? Discover available capabilities and
  honor explicit limits; do not impose a universal wall-clock cutoff.
- **Recency** — are the closest references current enough to define the frontier?

### Step 3.25 — apply the ambition gate

A publishable/doctoral candidate cannot enter the serious shortlist unless all
four questions have evidence-backed answers:

**Standard:** nontrivial technical core, verified originality, claim-relevant
formal/causal grounding, and field-level consequence.

1. **Hard technical core:** What is technically difficult, and what nontrivial
   mechanism solves it? If a prompt, JSON format, generic verifier, or workflow
   wrapper captures the whole idea, reject it.
2. **Verified originality:** What did the closest papers and systems not already
   do? The prior-art assassin must fail to reduce the contribution to an existing
   method plus renamed components.
3. **Genuine foundation:** State the formal or causal model, assumptions,
   invariants, and derived predictions. A theoretical claim needs an actual
   derivation/proof obligation that changes the algorithm, falsifier, or expected
   evidence; an empirical systems claim needs a mechanism whose predictions
   distinguish it from simpler explanations. Never add physics or mathematics
   for appearance.
4. **Frontier significance:** If the idea works, what general scientific belief,
   design principle, or capability changes? A local product metric, convenient
   implementation, or benchmark-only win is insufficient without a broader
   decision-changing consequence.

Score feasibility separately. Ease of execution cannot rescue a candidate that
fails technical depth, originality, foundation, or significance.

### Step 3.5 — diagnose the bottleneck, then select a research move

Before writing candidates, sharpen each top-ranked cluster into a *structural
bottleneck* and choose the *research move* that closes it. This keeps generation
at "move-applied-to-gap" rather than free brainstorming.

1. **Method-lineage + gap type.** Arrange the 3–5 closest retrieved methods into
   a refine/replace lineage (each node refines or replaces an earlier one). From
   it, name ONE concrete structural gap and classify it:
   - **ADDITIVE** — an unmet need at a leaf; or
   - **SUBTRACTIVE** — a load-bearing assumption every method in the lineage
     inherits that you could *remove* (often the stronger, more surprising move).

   Then a **regression check**: confirm your fix is NOT something an older
   ancestor already did. The gap must rest on what the retrieved papers actually
   show, not on model recall.

2. **Select the research move (pattern).** Read the corpus-derived ideation
   patterns bundled with this skill:
   `references/ideation/ideation-patterns/overview.md` (15 patterns; each has a
   definition + operational signature + when-to-apply inlined — under
   `argus_builtin_skills/**/references/ideation/`; find by filename if the exact
   path differs). Pick the **1–3 patterns** whose operational signature
   structurally closes the gap (`ideation-patterns/companion-combos.md` shows
   which patterns pair into one paper — k=2 is the modal composition). The
   pattern is diagnostic vocabulary — never the contribution claim itself, and
   never a hard filter: a common pattern is fine if the delivery is substantive.

3. **Read the sub-pattern tactical card.** For the chosen pattern, open the ONE
   matching sub-pattern card in `references/ideation/ideation-sub-patterns/`
   (the `ideation-sub-patterns/overview.md` table maps every `C##` to its parent
   pattern). Follow its **Step-by-Step** to instantiate the mechanism, and read
   its **failure-mode** panel so the candidate visibly avoids that cluster's
   documented rejection (`references/ideation/anti-patterns.md` lists
   reject-enriched compositions to steer clear of).

### Step 4 — write IDEA_CANDIDATES.md

> **Pre-seeded candidates**: a codex live-web-search pass may have already
> appended candidates to `research/IDEA_CANDIDATES.md` under a
> `<!-- source: codex-web-search -->` marker (ids `WS-N`). Treat these as an
> ADDITIONAL source — MERGE and re-rank them alongside your own `I-N` clusters,
> do NOT overwrite them. Apply the operator's constraints (target venue,
> resource/time budget) here during ranking, not as a filter on the raw pool.

For each top-ranked cluster, produce:

```markdown
## Candidate I-1: <one line: the contribution and question it resolves>

**Problem & gap**: <what's open + the strong prior work/baseline that leaves it open>

**Bottleneck (gap type + regression check)**: <the structural gap from Step 3.5;
label ADDITIVE or SUBTRACTIVE; one line on the regression check — which ancestor
could already do this, and why yours differs>

**Research move (pattern → sub-pattern)**: <the selected pattern(s) by name and
the `C##` sub-pattern whose Step-by-Step you instantiated; name the failure mode
you are avoiding>

**Contribution shape**: <method, system, theorem, diagnostic, characterization,
evaluation, benchmark/data contribution, negative result, or boundary finding>

**Hard technical core**: <the nontrivial algorithm/system/formal mechanism; why a
prompt, schema, wrapper, or scale-up is insufficient>

**Formal or causal foundation**: <objects, assumptions, invariants, and the
derived algorithm/bound/threshold/scaling law/falsifier; if using physics, map
Agent variables to measurable quantities; no decorative math>

**Reference comparison + target**: <the strongest relevant published/standard
reference, the public benchmark(s), and what outcome would support or refute the
research claim>

**Why it matters (thesis)**: <one sentence — the non-obvious insight or
decision-relevant value>

**Frontier significance**: <what general belief, design principle, or capability
would change if the claim is true>

**Experiment sketch (resource-adaptive)**:
- Setup: <models / data / baselines + the method>
- Falsifier: <what result would refute or materially weaken the claim>
- Compute & budget: <method-appropriate resources, staged execution, and the
  operator-approved budget>

**Local Feasibility** (read this turn's `## GPU Resource Allocation` /
`## Available APIs` / operator-constraint blocks and `nvidia-smi` — do NOT assume
a model/GPU you cannot actually run here; if the operator/direction states a
resource or time limit, that wins):
- Method runs on: <API-call | local inference | local training (LoRA/FT)>
- GPU memory needed vs free: <est. vs discovered free memory>
- **Can the probe answer the research question on public evidence within the
  available budget?**: YES / NO / CONDITIONAL
- **Executable on deployed setup**: YES / NO / CONDITIONAL (condition: <...>)

**Novelty bet**: <what makes this a new method, not a re-run of the cited work>

> A candidate with no credible evidence path inside the available resources is
> not executable yet. Stage it, narrow the claim, seek additional resources, or
> pivot before the signal-de-risk gate.

**Anticipated kill-argument**: <strongest 50-word rejection a hostile
reviewer would write; this skill must articulate it so kill-argument
later can stress-test it for real>
```

### Step 5 — review each route as it lands

Every route has its own fresh `idea-review` task. That reviewer searches for the
nearest implementation, benchmark, negative result, and simpler explanation,
then judges novelty, technical depth, theoretical/causal foundation, frontier
significance, falsifiability, benchmark validity, and local feasibility. Local
ease cannot rescue a shallow or already-occupied idea. Flag theory-only or
AI-frontier-only coverage and inspect the missing side when useful, but do not
reject or block solely for source-bucket imbalance.

### Step 6 — select at the 80% review quorum, then smoke once

Wait until at least 80% of the 12 routes have completed independent reviews:
`ceil(12 × 0.8) = 10`. Do not wait for the final two. Give those ten route and
review artifacts to one fresh selector Agent, which chooses the strongest idea
qualitatively by theory, novelty, generality, top-conference shape, and credible
evidence path. The selector writes `research/IDEA_SELECTION.json`.

Only the selected route receives one advisory probe, normally within ten
minutes. It must not run a full benchmark, training job, broad sweep, or
publication-scale multi-seed evaluation. Its supported/refuted/inconclusive
evidence cannot reverse the selector's judgment; weak results become later
implementation or experiment-design notes. The final two routes may finish in
the background but do not block planning.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Start with "I want to do X" — the gap-discovery step is supposed
  to surprise you. If your candidate list is what you walked in with,
  you skipped the discovery.
- ❌ Dismiss a diagnostic, characterization, taxonomy, benchmark, or negative
  result merely because it does not propose a new model. Judge whether it
  resolves an important question with rigorous evidence.
- ❌ Reject a direction solely because it exceeds an arbitrary wall-clock
  threshold. Require a credible staged plan and explicit resource needs.
- ❌ Use only one literature source — confirmation bias by source
  bubble. Three independent sources minimum.

## Output contract

For broad publishable/doctoral paper ideation, preserves route and review
artifacts under `research/ideation/portfolios/<direction>/`. After ten reviews,
writes the selector Agent's winner to `research/IDEA_SELECTION.json` and one
short advisory observation under the same portfolio. The final two routes never
block the selected idea from entering planning.
