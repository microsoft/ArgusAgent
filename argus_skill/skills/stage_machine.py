    *whichever* stage happened to be current, and the word "final" lived only in
    :func:`argus_skill.manager.stage_decider.final_stage_completion_decision` —
    a decision-layer check a caller reaches this primitive without passing
    through. Run 13 (``s-d9ea298f``) is what that costs. Its Engineer, blocked
    on ``staged_goal_gate_incomplete``, imported this module and called this
    function at ``scope``, stage 1 of math's ``scope -> solve -> review``. The
    primitive did exactly as asked: ran only ``scope``'s validator, stamped a
    valid contract fingerprint, and — via ``_set_stage(direction="complete")`` —
    marked ``solve`` and ``review`` ``skipped``. The result passes
    ``_vertical_completion_record``'s structural audit *perfectly*, because it
    was not hand-forged; it was minted by this function. Reviewing the math was
    never required. ``completed_by`` was ``"manager-repair"``, a string that
    appears nowhere in this codebase.

    So: completion is refused off the final stage unless the caller says, in
    this argument, that it has the standing to complete early. The Manager
    passes it when ``direct`` workflow mode is resolved, which is the one
    legitimate early-completion path and matches the flag
    ``final_stage_completion_decision`` already takes. Everyone else — every
    agent that can ``import argus_skill`` — now gets a ``ValueError``.

    This is a lock, not a signature. ``completed_by`` remains free text and the
    contract fingerprint remains recomputable by anyone who can read the
    framework source, so a determined caller can still pass the argument. What
    it stops is the *accident-shaped* forgery: reaching for a function whose
    name promised a check it did not perform.
