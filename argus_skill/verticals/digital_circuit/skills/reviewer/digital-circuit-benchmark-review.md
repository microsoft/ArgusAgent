# Digital Circuit Benchmark Review

## Review protocol

1. Verify the dataset revision/source, selected task IDs, score definition, evaluator/tool versions, model/backend, budget, and repair cap were frozen before results.
2. Confirm each task used a unique workspace and that concurrent agents never wrote the same workspace.
3. Confirm the agent received only allowed prompt/context: no golden patch/output, hidden harness source, other task solution, or network-derived answer.
4. Confirm every prompt-referenced pre-existing public file was present before generation. Reject and label the task as a packaging defect when a referenced specification/context file is absent; do not allow repeated oracle failures to reconstruct that missing contract.
5. Require a non-empty RTL patch and real official harness execution in a fresh output prefix.
   A no-execution/evaluator-infrastructure result is reported separately and
   supports no RTL correctness conclusion.
6. Treat the first official result as immutable Pass@1 evidence. Repairs must append new records and must never rewrite the first attempt.
7. For oracle-guided repair, verify only the allowed failure log crossed the isolation boundary and the repair stayed within the declared cap.
8. Recompute aggregate metrics from the attempt ledger. Do not divide attempt successes by attempt count and call that Pass@1; Pass@1 has one first-attempt row per task.
9. Keep post-repair success, cost, elapsed time, and failure taxonomy separate from the official first-attempt headline.
10. Reject stale image/patch reuse, mutable scorer inputs, concurrent shared Docker scoring, missing raw evidence, or selective omission of failed tasks.
11. Compare agents only on the same frozen task set, scorer, model class, budget, toolchain, and repair policy.
12. Reject an interface manifest that silently changes a public module, port,
    width, signedness, or timing contract. Require an explicit ambiguity list and
    public-request provenance for any interface bug fix.
13. Require prompt-derived local checks for exact expression sizing/signedness,
    combinational versus sequential and prior-state behavior, reset
    polarity/synchronicity, latency, initialization uncertainty, and exhaustive
    or metamorphic coverage when the public state/input space permits.
14. If the official signature is unchanged, require a changed public-only
    hypothesis and changed task-local regression. Do not retain mismatch vectors
    or turn hidden behavior into a test.
