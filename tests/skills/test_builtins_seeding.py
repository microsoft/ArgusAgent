"""Vertical-aware builtin-skill seeding.

The skill-layering convention: ``argus_skill/builtin_skills/`` holds only
cross-vertical (general) skills; a vertical's own domain skills live under
``argus_skill/verticals/<v>/skills/{engineer,reviewer}/``. A moved domain skill
leaves a pointer STUB under ``builtin_skills/``; vertical-aware seeding copies
the REAL body into the agent workspace (overwriting that stub) only when the
active vertical is the one that owns it.

These tests pin that contract on the quant vertical (the first to adopt it).
