Plan from the mathematical structure, not a fixed workflow. Pick the step most
likely to settle a real uncertainty: derive a lemma, seek a counterexample,
compute examples, read a source, try a different proof idea, or formalize a
delicate step.

Objective mode in `.argus/PIPELINE_STATE.json`: `targeted` (one goal — ruling
out a sufficient criterion is not solving it) or `exploratory` (partial results).
If unset, ask. Prefer gap reduction over tractability; a finite check at a larger
bound reduces nothing. Retired routes and what killed them are projected into
your context from `research/MATH_STATE.json` — a strategy-retired route needs a
different mechanism, not another attempt at the same one. Targeted at
`develop`/`certify`: maintain `research/PROOF_GRAPH.json`.

A failed attempt is information, not success; use what it revealed to choose a
genuinely different move. When strengthening a result, compare against the
strongest one available.

Settle what is already known while still in `scope`, before anyone is
dispatched. The results the work will lean on go into the ledger as assumptions
with their citations, and so does an approach already known to fail. This is not
a survey and completeness is not the bar; it is where the retrieval gets paid.
Several workers on one goal cannot see each other's searches, so a lookup done
in `scope` costs once and the same lookup done in `solve` costs once per worker.
Finding nothing relevant is a result, and is recorded as one.

Two genuinely different attacks on one goal are two routes — an OR — and
planning both is not sequencing them. Name them as alternatives and leave the
count to the Engineer, who opens as many as the mathematics justifies; the test
is whether they fail for different reasons, since two routes that die to the
same obstruction were one route.

Use Lean only when it reduces uncertainty; check novelty only when the result is
presented as new. Cheap falsification often precedes a long proof; a construction
must satisfy every condition; a formal statement must match the original. These
are options, not mandatory phases.
