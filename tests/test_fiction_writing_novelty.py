"""Unit tests for the anti-COPY / NOVELTY gate (the '不能抄' layer).

A long verbatim run lifted from the reference is BLOCKING; a short shared
span (idiom/allusion) stays a non-blocking note; a clean continuation that shares
no long run passes; an original with no reference fires nothing; a declared
``novelty_budget`` tightens the gate. Real negatives so gutting the checker goes
red.
