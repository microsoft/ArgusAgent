"""The contract's constraint sections were structurally unreachable.

``VerticalDecision`` has carried ``precise_constraints`` and ``ambiguities``
since the contract was introduced, and ``front_door`` reads all three of
constraints/exclusions/ambiguities off the decision to build
``goal_contract.json``. ``render_contract`` gives each its own heading in every
prompt that shows the contract.

None of it could ever fire:

* ``_DECISION_KEYS`` — the complete list of lines ``_decision_fields`` reads —
  named neither ``PRECISE_CONSTRAINTS`` nor ``AMBIGUITIES``, so
  ``_stated_requirements`` looked up keys the parser could not produce;
* the prompt never asked the Manager for them, so even a tolerant reader had
  nothing to read;
* ``exclusions`` had no field on ``VerticalDecision`` at all —
  ``front_door.py`` reached it through ``getattr(decision, "exclusions", ())``,
  which is a spelling of ``()``.

Testbed runs 15 (``s-f0dbba19``) and 16 (``s-ed5b69fc``) both wrote
``{"precise_constraints": null, "exclusions": null, "ambiguities": null}``.
Every downstream role was shown a contract with the operator's stated
requirements silently missing.

The three are read as one ``;``-separated line each, the same convention
``STAGES`` and ``LIVE_VIEW_PATHS`` already use.
