"""Regression test: a math project created through the product can complete.

``math_objective_mode`` gates *every* math stage — ``scope`` included, because
the objective check in ``verticals.math.stages`` runs before the stage
dispatch. Until this wiring landed, ``set_objective`` had exactly one
production entry point: the argparse CLI at the bottom of
``verticals/math/objective_mode.py``. Nothing in the Manager, front door,
webapi, daemon or any UI called it, and no agent prompt named the concept.

So a math project created through the real front door could not close a single
stage, and the only remedy was shell access to the host to run a module CLI.
"The operator decides" had been implemented as "an operator with shell access
decides". Every testbed run that appeared to work did so because a
development-time launch harness wrote the mode before the Manager was ever
invoked; scanning every recorded run's ``events.jsonl`` for an in-product
objective write returned nothing.

The fix is transcription, not choice: the operator's own request becomes the
goal, recorded as ``transcribed_from_request`` so it is distinguishable on
disk, and always under the *stronger* of the two bars so nothing is certified
against a bar looser than the operator would have picked.
