"""The Reviewer must be able to say that the plan itself is the obstacle.

Argus already routes such a challenge end to end: the Reviewer raises it, the
Manager decides whose authority it touches, and the Planner is handed the
challenged assumption with its next cycle. The channel was nonetheless
unreachable in practice. Its only key is ``plan_signal="reconsider"``, a word
that appeared in no prompt, and the one example the Reviewer was shown offered
an invalid ``keep``. On top of that the Reviewer's decision event is flat while
the JSON parser read the plan fields only from a nested ``planner_report``, so
a correctly formed challenge was dropped before anyone could route it.

The result was a campaign that could close round after locally correct round
with no way to question the design producing them. These tests pin the channel
open from prompt to Manager decision.
