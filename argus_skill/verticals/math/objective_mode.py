"""What "done" means for a mathematics project — a choice, not a default.

Two kinds of work get run through the same vertical and need opposite
completion rules:

``targeted``
    One named goal: prove this conjecture, or refute it. Everything else —
    lemmas, computations, ruled-out methods — is progress only insofar as it
    shrinks the gap to that goal. Ruling out a sufficient criterion is not
    solving the problem, and a project that drifts into perfecting such a
    refutation has stopped working on what it was asked to work on.

``exploratory``
    A direction rather than a target: find what is true near here, produce
    partial results, bounds, counterexamples, or structure worth reporting.
    There is no single G to close, so demanding one would reject genuinely
    useful work.

Guessing between them makes one of the two behave badly, so the operator
picks. An unset mode is reported rather than assumed: the two have different
completion bars, and silently choosing either is wrong in one direction.

The operator picks through the CLI at the bottom of this module, and that
choice is authoritative: nothing overwrites it. No model decides it either. A
vertical, a research target level, and a workflow mode are all read out of the
operator's request by the Manager because a wrong guess there costs a
misrouted mission; a wrong guess *here* silently changes what "finished"
means, and the project reports success against a bar nobody chose.

That used to be the whole channel, and it made the vertical unusable in the
product: a math project created through the real front door had no mode, every
stage refused to complete, and the only remedy was shell access to the host.
"The operator decides" had been implemented as "an operator with shell access
decides". So there is now a second, narrower way in —
:func:`adopt_operator_objective`, which restates the operator's own request as
a ``targeted`` goal when nobody has chosen anything. It is transcription, not
choice: it never overwrites a resolved objective, it records itself as
``transcribed_from_request`` so the two are distinguishable on disk, and it
only ever writes the *stronger* of the two bars, so nothing can be certified
under a weaker rule than the operator would have picked.

Waiting still has a cost and it is still paid up front: until the mode is set
by either route, every math stage refuses to complete — ``scope`` included,
because the objective gate in :mod:`argus_skill.verticals.math.stages` runs
before the stage dispatch. That is the intended shape. A project that ran
``scope`` to completion under an unchosen bar would have to be re-judged
afterwards against whichever bar was later picked, and the retrieval it did is
exactly the work that depends on knowing whether there is one goal to close.

    ``set_objective`` had exactly one production entry point: the argparse CLI
    at the bottom of this module. Nothing in the Manager, front door, webapi,
    daemon or any UI called it, and no agent prompt named the concept. Meanwhile
    an unset mode blocks *every* math stage — ``scope`` included, by design —
    and ``_ensure_stage_completion`` turns that into a ``StageCompletionError``
    the operator never sees. So a math project created through the real product
    could not close a single stage, and the only remedy was to shell into the
    host and run a module CLI. Every testbed run that appeared to work did so
    because a development-time launch harness wrote the mode before the Manager
    was ever invoked — a harness self-described as "not a fixture".

    "The operator decides" was implemented as "an operator with shell access
    decides", which is not the same thing. This is the difference: the operator
    already stated what they wanted when they opened the project, and this
    transcribes that statement rather than inventing one. The runtime is
    restating, not choosing — which is why the mode it writes is recorded as
    ``transcribed_from_request`` and why an operator value is never touched.

    The transcription is always ``targeted``, and that direction is deliberate:
    targeted is the *strictly stronger* bar (it additionally demands the named
    goal be proved or refuted — see ``_targeted_goal_closure_issues``), so a
    transcription can never let a project report success against a weaker bar
    than the operator would have picked. Loosening it to ``exploratory`` stays
    an explicit operator act, because that is the direction where a wrong guess
    costs something.

    Idempotent and non-destructive: a resolved objective from any source is
    left alone, so re-dispatching a mission never rewrites a goal mid-project.
