"""Daemon boot lifecycle phases: ``run_forever``'s pre-supervisor phases.

Split out of ``daemon.life_worker`` so that module stays under the
maintainability line-count target. ``LifeWorkerBootMixin`` is mixed into
``LifeWorker`` by the facade module. The construction of the
``LifeSupervisor`` uses a call-time lazy import back into ``life_worker`` so
that ``monkeypatch.setattr("argus_skill.daemon.life_worker.LifeSupervisor",
...)`` (used extensively by ``tests/daemon/test_life_worker.py``) keeps
working even though the method that constructs it now lives in this module.
