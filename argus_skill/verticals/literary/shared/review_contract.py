"""Shared literary-vertical REVIEW contract — the structured finding payload every literary
reviewer emits and the revise stage consumes.

Complementary to the framework Reviewer's named-line verdict envelope, which
carries the round OUTCOME (status / next_action / checklist). This module carries the domain
FINDINGS: a ``verdict`` plus a typed, severity-tagged, evidence-located,
fix-carrying list. The existing framework Reviewer ROLE is reused unchanged —
this is ONLY the payload contract its literary output must satisfy, not a new
reviewer agent.

The full loop this module makes enforceable, at run time (via a vertical's
STAGE_CHECKS) and in tests:

    reviewer text -> extract_review (JSON, never silent) -> normalize_review
    (defaults + structural schema + semantic rules) -> revision_plan (ordered
    instructions) -> assert_plan_covers (the revise output must address every
    blocking finding and preserve its must_not_break invariants)

``severity`` (critical|major|minor|note) and ``blocking`` are DECOUPLED: severity
is the importance axis, blocking is the independent gate axis, so a serious but
non-gating craft note (critical, non-blocking) and a hard continuity
contradiction (blocking) are both expressible without one field being redundant.
``type`` is a free string; each vertical owns its finding VOCABULARY (fiction
continuity types, poetry prosody types) and passes it as ``type_vocabulary``.
Explicit extension policy: reject an unknown type when a vocabulary is supplied;
accept any non-empty type when none is.

Semantic rules the JSON schema cannot express, all enforced by
:func:`validate_review`:

* if ANY finding is ``blocking``, ``verdict`` MUST be ``"revise"`` — a blocking
  finding can never coexist with a ``"done"`` verdict;
* if there are NO findings, ``verdict`` MUST be ``"done"`` — you cannot request a
  revision with nothing to act on.
