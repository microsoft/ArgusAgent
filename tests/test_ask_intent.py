"""`/ask` is the stated-intent path: answer, queue nothing, involve no one else.

Argus classifies free text as chat-or-task and deliberately biases toward
task, because silently answering something meant to be done is worse than
doing something meant as a question. The cost is that a quick question can
still buy a classify call and, when the classifier plays safe, a queued item
and a full four-role round.

`/ask` removes the guess rather than making the classifier more willing to
skip work — which is what keeps the automatic path safe to leave conservative.
