# Paper Framework Figure Studio Pro

Argus-native adaptation of `paper-framework-figure-studio-pro-v3.1.4a`.
The original skill uses strict human-in-the-loop step alternation; this
version replaces the human with the engineer agent, who executes S0-S7
autonomously in sequence. The agent reads the paper artifacts, extracts
facts, makes layout decisions, generates candidates, and audits the
result — doing everything a human collaborator would do.

Do not hand-write image prompts from scratch. Do not skip stages. Do not
use generic placeholder labels. The agent must read and understand the
actual paper before drawing anything.

## When to use

- The Research Visualization Router selected image-2 for a non-data conceptual
  figure and the secret-free capability status reports an available image route.
- Data/metric/result plots are NOT handled here; use matplotlib scripts.
- If image-2 is unavailable or a deterministic renderer better fits exact labels,
  topology, or editability, return to the router instead of invoking this skill.

## S0-S7 Workflow — Agent Executes Each Stage

The agent executes each stage below in order. Each stage must be completed
before moving to the next. This is the same S0-S7 workflow as the original
skill, with the agent acting as the human operator.

### S-1-CONTEXT-FREEZE — Freeze evidence and paper structure

Do not generate image candidates while claims or the paper structure are still
moving. First ensure these exist:

- `research/RESEARCH_BRIEF.md`
- `paper/style_ref/PAPER_STRUCTURE_BLUEPRINT.md`
- at least one of `paper/CLAIM_GRAPH.json`,
  `paper/artifacts/claims_evidence.tsv`, or `paper/RESULTS_REPORT.md`

Then run:

```bash
python -m argus_skill.verticals.research.figure_tool freeze-paper-context --project-root .
python -m argus_skill.verticals.research.figure_tool paper-cache-status \
  --project-root . --figure-type method
```

The freeze fingerprint deliberately excludes `paper/main.tex` and `main.pdf`.
Minor prose, citation, caption, and layout edits therefore reuse reviewed
candidates. Only a changed claim/evidence artifact or
`PAPER_STRUCTURE_BLUEPRINT.md` invalidates the cache.

### S0-PAPER-FOUNDATION — Read the paper and extract facts

The agent reads the project's research artifacts and method code to build
the factual foundation. This is NOT optional — it is the basis for
everything that follows.

Read these files:
- `research/NARRATIVE_REPORT.md`, `research/RESEARCH_BRIEF.md`
- `paper/RESULTS_REPORT.md`, `research/EXPERIMENT_PLAN.md`
- Method source code under `code/`
- `paper/main.tex` if it exists (for existing method description)

Extract and record (in working memory or a scratch file):
- **Module inventory**: every named module, component, model, or stage
- **Data/control flow**: what connects to what, arrows and their direction
- **Core contribution**: which module is the paper's main novelty
- **Core mechanism substeps**: the internal steps of the core module (these
  are `non_droppable_core_steps` — they CANNOT be hidden in an empty box)
- **Input sources / output targets**: what goes in and comes out
- **Baselines**: what the method is compared against
- **Benchmarks / evidence anchors**: evaluation datasets, key metrics
- **What must NOT appear**: no Argus internals, GPU IDs, API routes, etc.

### S1-FIGURE-STRATEGY — Decide figure type and reader path

Based on S0 extraction, decide:
- Figure type: method overview / architecture / pipeline / agent workflow
- Reader path: where should the eye go first? What is the story?
- Layout grammar: horizontal flow, nested containers, hub-spoke, etc.
- Information density: what goes in the figure vs caption vs legend
- Core mechanism visibility plan: how to show the main contribution
  (nested cards, inset, zoom panel — never an empty box)

### S2-SKETCH-EXPLORE — Generate diverse exploration candidates

Generate and review structurally different candidates until at least one
reviewed candidate passes — there is no fixed minimum batch size to grind
through before you are allowed to stop. Explore additional variants (up to 20)
only when you actually want alternative directions to compare. Generate
independent variants in parallel, then run `review` and `sync-paper-metadata`
for every candidate so it enters `IMAGE2_CANDIDATE_CACHE.json`.

Every `paper-prompt` call must pass `--project-root . --figure-type method`.
Check `paper-cache-status --figure-type method` before generating: once it
reports `reusable: true`, reuse the cached candidate instead of spending
another image call, unless `--ignore-reviewed-cache` is explicitly supplied.

### S3-DIRECTION-SELECT — Pick the best structural direction

Review the S2 candidates. Select 1-2 directions based on:
- Paper fidelity: does it faithfully represent the method?
- Core mechanism visibility: is the main contribution prominent?
- Reader path: is the story clear at first glance?
- Layout quality: clean, dense, no wasted space

### S4-CANDIDATE-BRIEF — Write candidate contracts with figure-caption co-design

For each selected direction, prepare a formal candidate contract:
- **Title**: short, paper-specific
- **Content block**: all labels spelled exactly as they should appear
- **Caption plan**: what the caption will explain (not drawn in pixels)
- **Legend plan**: arrow types, color meanings, icon semantics
- **Core mechanism visibility**: how the contribution is shown internally
- **Body reference**: how the paper text will refer to this figure

The content block must use actual project module names, NOT generic labels.

**DO** (example):
```
- Title: "PairScorer: Auxiliary Operation-Aware Candidate Ranking"
- Show: "HTML Context" -> "BoW Hash Encoder" -> "Pair Scoring Head" ->
  "Candidate Ranking" + "Auxiliary Op Head (9-class)" -> "Action Prediction"
- Core inset: "Pair Scoring Head" internals — [ctx, cand, |ctx-cand|,
  ctx*cand] concatenation -> MLP -> logit
- Benchmarks: "Mind2Web", "ALFWorld", "TravelPlanner"
```

**DON'T**:
```
- Show: "Source/input" -> "Parse/build step" -> "Quality gate" ->
  "Memory/state" -> "Agent/execution" -> "Output/result"
```

### S5-CANDIDATE-IMAGE — Generate refined formal candidates

Check the reviewed cache first (`paper-cache-status --figure-type method`). If
a passing candidate already exists for the frozen context, do not generate
again: select/refine the best cached candidate through caption and manuscript
integration. Otherwise generate only the additional variants you actually
want to compare, never exceeding 20 reviewed candidates for the figure type.
Refined candidates should be clean publication-ready references:
- Straight or gently curved connectors with consistent stroke weight
- Modular cards, panels, callouts, compact mechanism insets
- Restrained color coding and high contrast
- Semantically relevant icons chosen because they express the paper
- Short readable labels, not hand-written style
- The core contribution module shows its internal mechanism

```bash
python -m argus_skill.verticals.research.figure_tool paper-prompt \
  --project-root . --figure-type method \
  --out paper/figures/<id>.prompt.txt \
  --figure-title "<from S4>" --content "<from S4>" \
  --layout-variant "<from S4>" --force

python -m argus_skill.tools.image_api generate \
  --prompt-file paper/figures/<id>.prompt.txt \
  --out paper/figures/<id>.png --size 1536x1024 --force

python -m argus_skill.tools.image_api inspect --image paper/figures/<id>.png
python -m argus_skill.verticals.research.figure_tool review \
  --image paper/figures/<id>.png \
  --prompt-file paper/figures/<id>.prompt.txt \
  --out paper/figures/<id>.png.review.json
```

### S6-FINAL-SELECT — Choose and finalize the figure-text bundle

Select the best reviewed cached candidate. Ordinary prose/caption/layout edits
must not trigger regeneration while the context freeze remains current. Produce
the complete figure-text bundle:
- **Selected image path** (displayed/recorded)
- **Final title, caption, legend, body-reference text**
- **Paper recheck**: verify module names, arrows, and claims match the paper
- **Manuscript note**: if the figure reorganizes the method for clarity,
  note what writing changes the paper text needs

Copy the selected candidate to the stable final filename, then IMMEDIATELY
run sync-paper-metadata to align all hashes and metadata. Do NOT manually
edit JSON files to fix hashes — sync does it automatically:
```bash
cp paper/figures/<selected>.png paper/figures/method_overview.png
cp paper/figures/<selected>.png.json paper/figures/method_overview.png.json
cp paper/figures/<selected>.png.inspect.json paper/figures/method_overview.png.inspect.json
cp paper/figures/<selected>.png.review.json paper/figures/method_overview.png.review.json
cp paper/figures/<selected>.prompt.txt paper/figures/method_overview.prompt.txt

# MUST run sync immediately after copy — fixes all hash/metadata alignment
"${ARGUS_SKILL_PYTHON:-python}" -m argus_skill.verticals.research.figure_tool sync-paper-metadata \
  --project-root . --image paper/figures/method_overview.png \
  --prompt-file paper/figures/method_overview.prompt.txt \
  --figure-id method_overview --figure-type method
```

### S7-FINAL-JOINT-AUDIT — Terminal audit of figure + caption bundle

Review the selected figure + caption + legend + body-reference as ONE unit.
This is a bounded checklist, not an open-ended review:

| Check | What to verify |
|---|---|
| Paper fidelity | Module names match the paper; no invented components |
| Core mechanism | Main contribution is NOT an empty box; internal steps visible |
| Arrow semantics | Data flow directions are correct |
| Color/icon semantics | Colors and icons have consistent meaning |
| Label accuracy | Every label in the figure is spelled correctly |
| Figure-caption split | Image shows structure; caption explains details |
| Reader path | Eye flow matches the method's logic |

Verdict: `PASS`, `TEXT-REPAIR` (fix caption/legend → S6), `IMAGE-REPAIR`
(fix prompt → S4/S5), or `DIRECTION-REPAIR` (rethink layout → S1/S3).

If PASS: sync metadata and validate:
```bash
python -m argus_skill.verticals.research.figure_tool sync-paper-metadata \
  --project-root . --image paper/figures/method_overview.png \
  --prompt-file paper/figures/method_overview.prompt.txt \
  --figure-id method_overview --figure-type method

# Self-audit the image-2 figure requirements before handoff;
# the L2 reviewer verifies these artifacts directly against the draft/review stage checklists.
```

## Figure Rules

- A core contribution module cannot be an empty generic box. Show its
  internal mechanism through nested cards, a connected inset, a compact
  loop, or a small mechanism panel.
- The figure carries the reader path and structure; the caption carries
  definitions, caveats, and numeric evidence. Do not stuff explanatory
  text into image pixels.
- Generate 3 attempts per direction, pick the cleanest. Do NOT generate
  more than 3 per round — quality comes from better prompts, not more
  attempts. Common defects: misspelled labels, vertical text, overlapping
  cards. Re-prompt with sharper constraints; do not fix in post.
- If prompt/provenance/manifest hashes drift, run `sync-paper-metadata`
  from the real generated files. Do not patch JSON hashes by hand.
- Inside this image-2 route, do not post-process the accepted raster with local
  drawing tools or patch only metadata. If the result is weak, improve the
  prompt and regenerate; if image-2 is no longer appropriate, return to the
  router and explicitly register the replacement renderer.
