"""Reviewer-simulation structural gate.

Forces the paper-review-revision-loop skill to produce a concrete,
machine-readable list of "what a hostile reviewer will ask" with each
question paired to where the paper now addresses it. Anti-fab structural
check (same class as ``evidence_chain`` and ``paper_structural_minimums``):
without this artifact, the agent can claim "I reviewed the draft" without
having actually pre-empted any reviewer objection.

Contract — ``paper/REVIEWER_QUESTIONS.json``:

    {
      "schema_version": 1,
      "generated_at": "2026-06-03T12:00:00Z",
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": "Q1",
          "question": "Why is the baseline only random-prompt, not SOTA?",
          "severity": "critical" | "major" | "minor",
          "addressed_in_section": "5.2 Baselines" | "limitations" | "appendix B",
          "addressed_evidence": "Table 3 shows SOTA reproduction at row 4."
        },
        ...
      ]
    }

Gate fires when any of these hold:

* the file is missing
* fewer than ``MIN_QUESTIONS`` items (default 10 — reviewer would ask
  more than that on a real submission; floor is venue-minimum)
* any item missing a required field, or with ``addressed_in_section``
  empty (reviewer questions that aren't addressed are open blockers,
  not "reviewed")
* the file's mtime is older than ``paper/main.tex`` (the question set
  was generated against an earlier draft and is stale)

This is a venue-floor anti-fab gate, not a quality judgment: it does not
score "are these the RIGHT questions" — the reviewer agent owns that
call. We only enforce that the list exists, is non-trivial, and was
refreshed against the current draft.
