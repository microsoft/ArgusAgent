"""Lean evidence as runtime state, not paperwork.

``argus_skill.tools.lean_check`` can already compile one Lean file and say,
fail-closed, whether it proved anything. Nothing in this vertical read that
answer, so a project could carry a ``.lean`` file with a ``sorry`` in it and
still complete: the only mechanical gate was whether a JSON file existed.

This module wires the answer into completion. It draws one distinction that
Lean itself cannot:

**Proof validity** is whether the formal statement you wrote down was actually
proved. Lean decides that.

**Statement fidelity** is whether that formal statement says the same thing as
the mathematics you claim to have settled. Lean cannot decide that, and a
compiling proof of a mistranslated statement is the most expensive kind of
wrong answer this vertical can produce. So a Lean source without a separate,
substantive fidelity document is treated as unfalsifiable rather than as
evidence — the same separation ``prepare_canonical_lean_artifacts`` already
enforces by refusing to let the two be one file.

The governing rule is narrow and absolute:

    Formalizing is optional. Having formalized is a promise, and every promise
    here must be redeemable on demand.

So a project with no ``.lean`` file gets no issues and pays no import cost;
``lean_check`` is not even loaded. But once a ``.lean`` file exists, it must be
able to show a current, complete, hash-bound compiler result that says the
proof went through. Anything else blocks — including the cases where the
compiler never reached the mathematics at all.

That last point is the one worth being explicit about, because an earlier
version of this module got it wrong. A compile that failed because the host has
no Mathlib genuinely says nothing about the mathematics, and it is still
reported as such — ``lean_unverified_missing_dependency`` reads differently from
``lean_compile_failed``, so a reviewer can tell an environment gap from a broken
proof. What does *not* follow is that it should pass. Serious formalization
imports Mathlib; a host without Mathlib fails every such compile; excusing those
failures would switch the gate off in precisely the case it exists for. The
distinction survives in the message. It does not buy passage.

The escape hatch for a machine without a toolchain is not a lenient gate, it is
the optional step: do not commit a ``.lean`` file you cannot verify.

The gate never compiles. It reads recorded evidence, so a completion decision
costs a few file reads even when the project carries a proof that takes minutes
to build. Producing that evidence is the Engineer's step, through ``verify``
below — or, when the compile is long enough that waiting it out is the expensive
part, through the ``submit``/``reclaim`` pair in ``lean_async``, which records
the same thing on the same terms.

    in the presence of a document saying what the formal statement means, and
    without a digest that document could be rewritten after the compile to make
    a proof of one thing read as a proof of another — with every existing check
    still passing, because they only ask whether *some* substantive note names
    the declaration. Nothing here establishes that the note is *true*; no tool
    in this repository does, and no field claims otherwise.

    Both digests are taken *before* the compiler is started and re-taken after
    it returns, and a run whose source or note moved in between publishes
    nothing at all — see ``_refuse_if_moved_under_the_compiler``. Hashing after
    the compile, which is what this did, meant an edit landing inside the
    compile window produced a certificate carrying the new text's digest and the
    old text's verdict; every later check then agreed the record was current,
    because the recorded digest and the file on disk matched perfectly. There is
    no ordering of one read that fixes this, only two reads and a refusal.

    ``use_lake`` defaults to ``None``, meaning *decide from the host*: compile
    through ``lake env lean`` when a Lake workspace applies to this source, and
    through bare ``lean`` when none does. It used to default to ``False``, and
    that turned an installed Mathlib into a worse failure than no Mathlib at
    all — the library was on disk, the import still resolved to nothing, and
    the recorded verdict said ``missing_dependency``, which reads as "install
    Mathlib" to the one reader who already had. An Engineer cannot be expected
    to pass a flag whose only effect is to undo a default that was wrong.

    The decision stays here rather than in ``run_lean_check`` on purpose. That
    function is the primitive: it does what it is told, so its behaviour is a
    function of its arguments alone and its tests mean the same thing on every
    host. Which toolchain a *mission* should use is a policy question, and this
    is where the Math vertical answers it. The answer is recorded as
    ``lake_workspace`` in the result, because a compile whose search path was
    chosen for the caller must say so; an unexplained ``cwd`` three directories
    away is not an explanation.
