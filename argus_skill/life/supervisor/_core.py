"""``LifeSupervisor`` — owns the outer process, runs missions back-to-back.

Per the rubber-duck critique:

- Supervisor (not observer): we OWN the outer loop and call
  ``MissionExecutor.execute(...)`` once per backlog item. We never try
  to push ``/run`` into a finished single-mission daemon.
- Single inbox owner: we don't tail any JsonlCommandBus. The optional
  ``user_inbox`` callable lets a host process feed user-provided
  high-priority objectives into the supervisor's own queue without two
  consumers racing on the same offset file.
- Bounded autonomy: ``LifeBudget`` enforces a per-mission preflight cap
  AND a daily cap. Defaults are generous enough for long polish runs
  (max 6 autonomous missions in one supervisor run, $30/mission,
  $180/day).
- Memory injection is a separate channel (``prelude_context``) — the
  objective string passed to the executor is unmodified, so skill
  matching, mission-id hashing, and reviewer prompts are unaffected.
- Idle = sleep, not spin. We poll every 5 seconds when there's nothing
  to do.

The supervisor is intentionally **synchronous**: one mission at a
time, no thread pool. That matches "an agent with continuity" — the
agent is doing one thing, then the next, like a person.

# Legacy heartbeat used by budget pauses and tests that exercise the old idle

# Stall escalation: after this many consecutive idle planner cycles concluding the
# same external dependency blocks progress, dispatch ONE domain-agnostic
# verification-probe mission so the agent TESTS its (possibly stale) belief against
# CURRENT reality instead of waiting forever on a memory of the blocker. Rate-limit
# repeat probes with the cooldown below.

# Operator escalation: after this many consecutive missions that COMPLETED but the
# L2 reviewer judged forward_progress=false (work happened, the goal did NOT
# advance — e.g. repeated no-score / blocked-archive refuges), surface a loud,
# operator-notified stall alert. This counts ONLY the reviewer's own signal — the
# harness never decides what "progress" is; it just refuses to let the agent
# system loop invisibly without bringing the human in.
