"""Decompositions: what a route can settle, and the several things it cannot.

The six things PR3 asked for, in the order it asked for them. Three of them —
a route's obligations are an AND, a shared lemma is proved once, an exact
counterexample refutes — were already true of the kernel PR1 shipped, and are
*pinned* here rather than implemented; each of those tests says so in its own
docstring, because "already true" and "newly built" are different claims about
this package and a reader cannot tell them apart from a green suite. What is
new is the OR (a claim now reports the routes aimed at it) and cycle detection
(refused when written, reported when loaded).

Everything below turns on one rule: a route asserts that its obligations imply
its goal, and nothing in this package checks that implication. So a finished
route does not prove the goal, a dead route does not refute it, and both facts
have to be *said* — silence about either one reads as the opposite.
