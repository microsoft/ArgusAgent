"""Verticals API + vertical-aware System-(B) stage checklists.

The auto-research loop runs ONE of two *verticals*, selected by a single
``vertical`` field in ``research/PIPELINE_STATE.json``:

* ``research`` (the default) — the full eight-stage paper pipeline. Its
  checklist output is byte-identical to the historical hard-coded behaviour.
* ``speedrun`` — the lean 4-stage (setup/optimize/measure/report)
  numeric-optimization vertical: lower one number (mean val bpb) under a fixed
  wall-clock budget, no paper.

These tests pin the vertical-native API (the keyword classifier + old
paper|optimize "pipeline mode" shims are gone — the Manager AGENT now decides
the vertical; see tests/manager/):

* ``resolve_vertical`` precedence — persisted Manager-authored data domain >
  explicit non-default env ``ARGUS_SKILL_VERTICAL`` > persisted built-in
  ``vertical`` > RAISE (fail-hard, no default).
* ``persist_vertical`` / ``require_vertical`` reject unknown verticals (raise).
* ``format_full_pipeline_checklist`` renders research's 8 stages by default and
  speedrun's 4 stages under ``ARGUS_SKILL_VERTICAL=speedrun``.
* the speedrun reviewer banner is the INNOVATION-COACH override.
