"""The Project's goal contract: what was asked for, and what may change it.

North-Star review §4.1/§4.2/§5.2. The pieces of a goal contract already existed
— ``mission.json`` carries the objective, the acceptance check and non-goals,
campaign identity hashes the objective, and ``VerticalDecision`` carries the
target level and venue — but they were fragments with no single type and no
rule about who may rewrite which part.

Clause ``kind`` describes verification: ``precise`` is mechanically checkable,
while ``semantic`` requires judgment. Its independent ``authority`` says who
may change it: operator-owned requirements need specific confirmation; explicitly
manager-owned working parameters may be refined autonomously, regardless of kind.
An unpublished-data boundary can require judgment without becoming freely mutable.

New unannotated requirements default to operator ownership. Legacy files preserve
their historical defaults only during loading (precise: operator, semantic:
manager), without rewriting files or clause ids. Explicit authority always wins.
The objective and exclusions also belong to the operator; ambiguities are questions.

Deliberate non-goal: this module does not decide whether a project is finished.
Completion lives in :mod:`argus_skill.core.project_api`, and existing projects
are exempt from contract-based completion (operator decision §9.6). Writing a
contract is additive today — it records what the Manager committed to and
disciplines later edits.
