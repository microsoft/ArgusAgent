"""Round-loop phase: engineer prompt/context assembly.

Owns building the per-round engineer prompt (static task/skill contract on
round 1 or when compact continuation prompts are disabled; otherwise a
compact Reviewer-delta prompt), attaching the shared CHECKPOINT.md and the
background-subagent / external-work
advisories, and emitting the ``round.start`` event. This is purely prompt
text assembly — it makes no completion or control-flow decisions.
