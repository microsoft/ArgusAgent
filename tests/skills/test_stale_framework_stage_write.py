"""A self-maintenance canary must not roll the running framework backwards.

Bugs #41 and #42, one cause, observed live in testbed run 5 (s-e25c3b7c).

At 01:05:37 the daemon handed itself off to a repair canary running out of
``self-maintenance/worktrees/a1e7d7f19c9fc4ef``. ``_prepare_worktree`` branches
from ``main``, and ``git worktree add`` materializes committed content only, so
that canary was 36 commits behind and — decisively — missing every uncommitted
edit in the operator's checkout. Two of those edits mattered:

* ``REQUIRE_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW = True`` on the math vertical. Absent from the
  canary, ``getattr(provider, "REQUIRE_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW", False)`` answered
  False and the next 14 missions closed on the Engineer's own say-so (#42).
* A third ``scope`` checklist item. The canary stamped a completion fingerprint
  computed from its own two-item checklist; the operator's framework recomputes
  three and rejects it. The Goal Gate then refused its own ledger until the
  daemon idled out at 02:59, and the rejection printed the *final* stage's
  fingerprint rather than the disputed one, so the number it complained about
  appeared nowhere in the file (#41).

Nothing here tests git plumbing. It tests that a canary which cannot contain the
running framework is declined, that a resolved vertical fails closed, and that a
mismatched certificate says which stage and which two hashes disagree.
