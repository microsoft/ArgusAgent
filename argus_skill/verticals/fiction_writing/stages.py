"""fiction_writing-vertical stage definitions.

A vertical whose deliverable is NOT a number and NOT a paper, but a piece of
NARRATIVE PROSE (a short story or a chapter, zh or en) written from a brief or
continued from existing text — together with a faithful, structured
``story_state`` that keeps characters, world, timeline, items, threads, and
foreshadowing consistent across chapters.

The 6 stages (``completion_gate="none"`` — the reviewer verdict ends the
mission; there is no metric and no paper submission):

1. **intake**: normalize the operator's request into ``fiction/creative_brief.json``
   (language, form, mode=from_scratch|continuation, genre, market_style, length,
   viewpoint, tense, constraints) and a checkable ``fiction/style_profile.json``
   (abstract style features — sentence rhythm, narrative distance, dialogue
   ratio, imagery density, exposition level, ending strategy). Style is captured
   as ABSTRACT FEATURES, never as "imitate author X".

2. **plan**: produce ``fiction/story_plan.json`` (premise, arc, beats, cast) and
   ``fiction/chapter_goal.json`` (what THIS chapter must accomplish). For a
   continuation, the plan is grounded in the EXISTING ``story_state``.

3. **draft**: write ``fiction/draft.md`` — the chapter prose, honoring brief +
   style profile + (for continuation) the established state.

4. **state_update**: extract what CHANGED into ``fiction/state_patch.json`` and
   apply it through the safe patch engine to produce
   ``fiction/story_state.json``. The writer NEVER hand-rewrites the whole state
   — it emits a structured patch that is program-validated (idempotent, no
   silent deletion of prior state, valid id references, parseable timeline).
   See ``argus_skill.verticals.fiction_writing.state``.

5. **review**: the reviewer produces ``fiction/review.json`` — typed, severity-
   tagged, evidence-located findings across CONTINUITY (dead characters
   returning, knowledge the character shouldn't have, item teleport, location
   clashes, timeline breaks, world-rule violations, motive-incoherent actions,
   foreshadowing dropped/leaked, viewpoint/tense drift, language drift) and
   CRAFT (style consistency, character-voice distinctness, scene concreteness,
   show-don't-tell, over-summarization, mechanical twists, pacing, ending
   closes the core question, obvious AI-tells). Craft/aesthetic items are
   HEURISTIC self-checks + non-blocking comments + a few observable proxies —
   NOT a deterministic pass/fail gate (there is no ground-truth score).

6. **revise**: apply the review's targeted fixes into ``fiction/final.md`` and
   ``fiction/updated_story_state.json``. The reviewer verdict ends the mission.

Design invariants (harness-enforced; all narrative judgment is the agent's):

* ``story_state`` is only ever mutated through a validated ``state_patch``; the
  engine refuses to delete undeclared prior state and rejects dangling id
  references — so history cannot be silently lost (``state.apply_patch``);
* language is an ADAPTER over one shared narrative core: characters, world,
  timeline, plot, threads, and memory are language-agnostic; only style
  guidelines and anti-AI patterns are per-language (zh/en);
* genre / market style (suspense, romance, web-fiction, literary, ...) are
  PROFILES/data in the brief, never separate verticals;
* aesthetic "AI-flavor" quality is never faked as a deterministic score — it is
  a self-check + non-blocking reviewer comment layer.
