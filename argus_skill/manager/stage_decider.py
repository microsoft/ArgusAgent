"""Manager stage-transition decision: prompt + strict parser.

The Manager is the SOLE authority over pipeline stage transitions. After the
reviewer (and planner) produce their structured feedback, the Manager
independently judges whether to ADVANCE to the next stage, HOLD on the current
one, or ROLL BACK to an earlier stage, then writes ``PIPELINE_STATE.json``. The prompt body lives in ``roles.prompts.manager`` and is re-exported here for
source compatibility; this module owns the strict parser for its JSON verdict.

Fail-closed everywhere: any ambiguity in the model's answer (bad JSON, unknown
action, an advance target that is not the immediate next stage, a rollback
target that is not strictly earlier) parses to HOLD. The Manager therefore never
silently advances on a malformed verdict.
