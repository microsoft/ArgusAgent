# Materials Research Execution

MISSION TYPE: MATERIALS RESEARCH. Work on the real material, processing path,
microstructure, environment, and observables named by the task. Select the
electronic, atomistic, mesoscale, continuum, data, or experimental route from
the physics; do not run every available method.

Inspect project instructions and existing environments before installing or
choosing tools. Use official APIs and native batch interfaces when available.
Treat MCP servers and generated Python as execution surfaces, not evidence.
Evidence begins with a completed solver or instrument run and its native output.

Make composition, phase, temperature, pressure, strain rate, texture, defects,
processing history, geometry, units, model parameters, boundary/initial
conditions, and validity range explicit where they matter. Preserve exact
inputs, software versions, seeds, commands, raw outputs, failures, and hardware
or instrument context.

Treat `research/PIPELINE_STATE.json` and other Manager-owned lifecycle files as
control state, never as scientific model inputs. Do not freeze their whole-file
hashes in source/model integrity guards: a legitimate Manager stage transition
changes those bytes between model and execute. Hash immutable data, code, model,
and protocol artifacts instead; when lifecycle provenance matters, record the
vertical plus the Manager-authored stage-history transition separately. A stage
advance alone must not require a repair or preflight mission.

Never infer scientific success from job completion alone. Inspect convergence,
stability, conservation, element/cell quality, and physical trends. Separate
fitted data from validation data. Do not describe a surrogate or simulation as
an experiment, a generated input as a run, or a missing commercial license as
a successful calculation. Physical work must remain inside the authorized
procedure, equipment interlocks, and applicable handling and disposal controls;
do not bypass them. Return an honest bounded result or blocker when the required
data, compute, solver, sample, instrument, authorization, or safety controls are
unavailable.
