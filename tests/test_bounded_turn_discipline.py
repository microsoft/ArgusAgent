"""Regression: the engineer mission prompt must instruct bounded-progress turns.

Each fresh Engineer turn should land a coherent increment, update the shared
checkpoint, and yield. This file also guards the fixed prompt against token
re-bloat.

These tests lock in that the turn-discipline / bounded-progress contract is
present in the engineer prompt, for both paper and non-paper missions.
