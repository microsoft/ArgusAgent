"""Test-suite isolation guard.

Some tests drive real entry points (``apps.cli.main``, the TUI/web launch path).
Those resolve their state root from ``ARGUS_SKILL_HOME`` at call time, so a test
that does not set it writes into the DEVELOPER'S REAL ``~/.argus-skill``.

That is not a cosmetic leak. Observed on this checkout: running
``tests/apps/test_cli_parser.py`` created real sessions named after the test's
own objective string, spawned real daemons against the real home, and those
daemons ran the real Manager — including its self-maintenance loop, whose
Engineer then EDITED THE SOURCE CHECKOUT while the suite was running. The
spawned daemon also killed the pytest process partway through the file, so the
run ended with no summary and every later failure was invisible.

This fixture pins every state root at a per-test temporary directory. A test
that deliberately wants its own value still wins: ``monkeypatch.setenv`` inside
the test body runs after this fixture.
