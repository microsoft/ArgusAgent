"""Filtered-task planner feedback must outlive background-job file churn.

Regression for the run-08 replan loop: while frozen GPU workers and their
finalizer kept rewriting project files, the whole-tree evidence signature
changed every cycle, so "all proposed tasks were filtered" feedback was
cleared within one cycle, the idle backoff reset to base, and the planner
made a full model call roughly every backoff period indefinitely. Feedback
with the filtered diagnostic is now judged against the backlog's own state:
it persists (and its attempt count climbs toward the repeat limit) until a
backlog item actually changes status.
