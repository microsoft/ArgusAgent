"""The write path into the research-math kernel, and the one thing it refuses.

``argus_skill/proof_ledger/`` can express everything a mathematics project
believes and derive what that adds up to. Until this module there was no way to
put anything into it from a real run: the package had a store, an assessment,
and no writer, so ``research/MATH_STATE.json`` was a file that only tests ever
created. This is the writer.

**The rule this module exists to enforce.** ``MathState.add_evidence`` takes any
tier, because a legitimate producer of each one has to be able to reach it. That
makes the *command surface* the place where tiers are decided, and it decides
them like this:

    A tier may only be written by a program that performed a check of that kind.

``judgement`` is the one tier whose checker is the agent, so it is the one tier
an agent-facing command writes. ``mechanical`` is written by
``record_lean_evidence`` below, which is reachable only from a command path that
compiles the source first — the tier is chosen by the code that read the
compiler's answer, never by an argument. ``literature`` is written by
``record_citation_evidence`` below, reachable only from ``citation_check``,
which retrieves and archives before it records. ``computational`` still has no
producer in this tree, so no command writes it; when a verifier for it exists,
it becomes the producer, exactly as the other two are here.

``literature`` is the tier whose producer needed the most care, because unlike
the other two it confers nothing: it is in none of ``KERNEL_TIERS``,
``DISCHARGING_TIERS``, or ``REFUTING_TIERS``, so a literature record cannot
promote or refute a claim however it was obtained. Withholding it bought no
status protection, and admitting it costs none. What is at stake is the tier's
meaning. The entire content of ``literature`` is the claim that a channel
*independent of the model's reasoning* answered — and when an agent simply types
it, the party asserting the independence is the party whose independence is in
question. That is precisely the failure the principles document reports as
surviving every retrieval harness: the paper exists, and the theorem it is said
to contain is not in it, or its hypotheses were quoted wrong.

So the producer is not "a command that accepts ``--tier literature``". It is a
command that retrieves, and then hands the retrieved material itself to
``record_citation_evidence``, which archives it under a path derived from its
own content and stamps the cited proposition into it before writing the record
that points there. There is no argument by which a checker can name an artifact
it did not supply the text of, and no window in which the archived text and the
recorded verdict can come apart. The verdict is still a reader's word — no
program in this tree can open a paper and see whether Theorem 3.2 says what the
proof needs. What the archive changes is that the word is now attached to the
text it was reached from, so a wrong one is *findable* by the next reader rather
than merely unfalsifiable. That is the whole difference between this and
``judgement``, and it is why the excerpt, not the tier flag, is the thing the
program insists on.

**Where this lives, and why not in the kernel.** ``argparse`` is standard
library, so this CLI could have lived inside ``proof_ledger/`` and travelled
with it. Two things decided against it. The first is the lock: every command
below is a read-modify-write over one JSON file, so without one, two rounds
writing at once lose one of the two writes — and the only lock in this
repository is ``core/file_lock.py``, which ``proof_ledger/`` may not import
without giving up the property its whole design is built on. A hand-rolled
``fcntl``/``msvcrt`` fork inside the kernel would be a second, weaker copy of
something this repository already has one of, and the kernel's own store
docstring says that adding a lock before the writer existed would be guessing at
its shape. The writer now exists; it is this module; the guess is unnecessary.
The second is that the tier rule above is *policy about this host's agents*, and
the kernel is deliberately policy-free about who writes what — it has to be, or
``lean_evidence`` could not write ``mechanical`` through the same API. Policy
belongs on the vertical side, next to ``lean_evidence`` and
``literature_ledger``, which is also where a reader looking for "how does a math
agent record a claim" will look.

The kernel loses nothing by having no CLI: a library lifted into another
repository arrives with that repository's own entry points, whereas a CLI that
cannot lock would be a defect it inherits.

**Reads take no lock.** ``show`` and ``check`` call ``load_state`` directly.
``save_state`` publishes through ``os.replace``, so a reader sees either the
whole previous state or the whole next one, never a torn file; paying for a lock
to serialize against a write that is already atomic would only make the common
operation slower.

    This is where ``closed_kernel`` becomes reachable, and therefore where the
    conditions on reaching it have to be complete. Four of them, and each closes
    a specific way a record could certify something nobody checked:

    *The result has to be admissible.* Every check ``lean_evidence`` already
    performs is re-run against the filesystem — proof holes, the recorded
    result's schema, the source digest, and the fidelity document — and any
    finding in ``_INADMISSIBLE_LEAN_CODES`` records nothing at all. A
    ``lean_check.json`` that says ``success`` and does not agree with itself is
    the cheapest forgery available, and it must not become the most expensive
    status in the schema.

    *The claim has to record the text that was compiled.* Lean's answer is about
    the file it read. ``ClaimVersion.formal_statement`` is inside the claim's
    digest, so requiring the two to agree is what makes a later retranslation
    cost the certificate: editing the Lean file and restating the claim mints a
    new digest and the old record stops binding. Skipping this check would let a
    proof of one formal statement certify a claim carrying another.

    *The fidelity document has to exist, say something, name the declaration it
    describes, and be the one that was in force when the compiler ran.* The
    first three are ``lean_evidence``'s own checks; the fourth is the digest
    recorded by ``verify_lean_source``. None of them establishes that the
    document is *true* — nothing in this tree does, and the honest consequence
    is that no field anywhere says fidelity was verified. What they establish is
    that a specific, unedited statement of intent accompanies the certificate,
    so the unproved half of the argument is written down and pinned rather than
    absent. Without one, the compiler's answer is not evidence about a
    natural-language claim at all, and nothing is recorded.

    *A failed compile is ``inconclusive``, never ``refutes``.* Lean failing to
    derive a statement is not a proof that the statement is false, and
    ``REFUTING_TIERS`` includes ``mechanical`` — so writing ``refutes`` here
    would let a broken proof, a timeout, or a missing Mathlib mark a true
    theorem false. ``Verdict.INCONCLUSIVE`` is in the schema for exactly this:
    a checker that ran and could not decide has said something, and it is not
    what a checker that never ran said.

    ``expect_result`` pins the record to the run the caller just performed: the
    artifact lock is released once ``verify_lean_source`` returns, and between
    then and here another process could publish a different answer to the same
    path.

    *And the citation has to keep naming this run.* ``expect_result`` closes the
    window before the record is written; nothing closed the one after it.
    ``verify`` publishes to fixed names — ``Main.lean``, ``lean_check.json``,
    ``statement_fidelity.md`` — so the next claim formalized in the same
    directory, which is what the Engineer doc teaches, overwrites the previous
    claim's certificate in place. The status stayed honest, because the record
    binds to the claim's own ``content_hash`` and a real compile of that text
    did happen; the *pointer* did not, because ``EvidenceRecord.artifact`` is a
    bare path with no digest, and a reviewer sent to it now reads a different
    theorem with nothing anywhere saying so. So the certificate is archived to a
    path derived from the record it belongs to before the record is written, and
    that archive is what ``artifact`` names. Failing to archive records nothing:
    an unarchived record is exactly the dangling citation this exists to
    prevent, and a silent one is worse than a refusal.

    """The archive's filename, derived from the record that will cite it.

    ``_evidence_id`` hashes (kind, subject, tier, verdict, produced_by,
    artifact), and the artifact is about to be this path, which reads as a
    circle. It is not one, because this digest is taken over *the same
    arguments minus the artifact*, plus the fidelity note's digest::

        artifact    = g(subject, tier, verdict, produced_by, fidelity)
        evidence_id = f(subject, tier, verdict, produced_by, g(...))

    Both are functions of the same free variables, evaluated in that order, so
    nothing waits on itself. What that buys is the property the archive exists
    for: two records with different ids differ in at least one of them, since
    the artifact cannot be the tie-breaker when it is derived from them — so
    ``g`` is injective over records, two of them can never overwrite each
    other, and one record recorded twice lands on the same path. That last part
    is what makes re-verifying idempotent rather than littering the directory
    with a copy per run.

    ``.json``, and deliberately never ``.lean``: ``discover_lean_sources`` finds
    project sources by extension, so an archived copy of the compiled source
    saved under its own name would become a *new* unverified Lean source,
    demanding its own fidelity document and its own compile, and
    ``lean_evidence check`` would start blocking on the evidence it was given.
    The source text is carried inside this file as a string instead, where no
    sweep can mistake it for work in progress.

    ``subject_id`` is free text, so it is folded to one safe path component
    before it becomes a filename; the digest, never the name, is what makes the
    path unique, so folding two ids together costs readability and nothing else.

    **Why the fidelity note is in the key.** ``fidelity_sha256`` is not part of
    the record — the record says which claim, tier, verdict, and checker — so
    including it here splits one record into two whenever only the note was
    rewritten. That is deliberate, and it costs something real: rewording a note
    for clarity mints a fresh certificate, and a reviewer who approved the old
    wording has to be asked again. The alternative was tried first and fails
    quietly. With the note left out, rewriting it and re-verifying the same
    proof landed on this same path and replaced the archived note in place;
    because the record itself was unchanged the command reported
    ``changed: false``, so a reviewer's "the formal statement says what the
    natural statement says" was re-pointed at a reading nobody had read.
    Statement fidelity is the one question no compiler answers, which makes it
    the one verdict that must not be allowed to drift onto text it was never
    given. A note that was right does not need rewriting; when it does get
    rewritten, something about the reading of the theorem changed, and that is
    exactly when a prior approval must stop counting.

    The second privileged writer, and the only one that takes a verdict from its
    caller. ``record_lean_evidence`` does not need to: it reads an answer a
    compiler produced. Nothing in this tree can open a paper and see whether
    Theorem 3.2 is there, so a citation check ends in somebody's word, and the
    question this function answers is what has to be true before that word is
    allowed to wear the ``literature`` label.

    The answer is: the text it was reached from has to exist here. ``retrieval``
    is the retrieved material — a registry's response, or the passage a reader
    read — and it is archived under ``research/literature/`` *before* the record
    that cites it, at a path derived from its own content. The verdict can still
    be wrong. It can no longer be unexaminable, which is the property
    ``ARTIFACT_REQUIRED_TIERS`` asks of this tier and the one an agent typing
    ``--tier literature`` could never supply.

    **The citation is stamped in, not passed in.** ``source_id`` and ``locator``
    are overwritten from the assumption this record is being filed against, so
    an archived excerpt cannot name one proposition while the record binds to
    another. Since they are part of the archived content and the path is derived
    from the content, an excerpt retrieved for ``Theorem 3.1`` and an excerpt
    retrieved for ``Theorem 3.2`` cannot collide, and correcting a locator later
    mints a new assumption whose ``ref()`` no old check binds to.

    **Why no lock.** The archive path is a function of the archived bytes, so
    any two writers racing on the same path are writing identical content and
    the loser of the race loses nothing. That is deliberate and it is the answer
    to the "several workers adding literature at once" problem: there is no
    shared mutable ledger of retrieved material to serialize on, only
    content-addressed files that concurrent writers agree about by construction.
    The state write below still takes ``locked_state``, because the state file
    is genuinely shared and mutable.

    Refusals record nothing. An unarchived retrieval is the dangling citation

    A defect the kernel cannot state, because it is about certificates and the
    kernel does not know what one is. Every record here is either a Lean
    certificate this vertical archived or something a reviewer chose to cite;
    only the first kind is checked, by the directory it sits in.

    The shape it catches: a reviewer reads a claim's certificate, judges that
    the formal statement says what the natural statement says, and records that
    with ``judge --artifact <certificate>``. Later the fidelity note is
    rewritten and the proof re-verified. The compiler answers as before, so the
    claim keeps its status — but the reading of the theorem it is paired with is
    a different one, ``retire_superseded_evidence`` has dropped the certificate
    the reviewer read, and their approval is now the only thing standing between
    that new reading and a ``closed_kernel`` nobody has checked. Statement
    fidelity is the one question the compiler does not answer, which is exactly
    why this verdict must not be inherited by a document it was not given.

    Clearable, and cheaply: read the certificate the claim now cites and judge
    again. That matters more than it sounds. A blocking defect whose message
    names a remedy that does not work is worse than no defect at all, because
    the agent it blocks will do what the message says and stay blocked.

    A judgement that cites nothing is not reported. It made no claim about which
    document it was reached from, so there is nothing here to contradict — and
    it is also not protected by this check, which is the reason the reviewer
    skill asks for the citation.
