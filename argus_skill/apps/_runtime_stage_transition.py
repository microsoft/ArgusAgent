"""Stage-transition mixin: ``StageTransitionMixin`` — hands each round's
reviewer verdict to the Manager (the sole writer of the
pipeline stage) and returns its advance/hold/rollback decision.

Split out of ``_runtime.py`` so that module stays under the maintainability
line-count target. Every name here is re-exported from ``_runtime.py`` (see
its module docstring and ``__all__``) so external imports are unaffected.
