"""Regression test: a completion primitive must enforce the check it is named for.

Testbed run 13 (``s-d9ea298f``) is the case. Its Engineer was blocked on
``staged_goal_gate_incomplete`` at ``scope``, stage 1 of math's ``scope ->
solve -> review``. It imported the framework and called
``complete_final_stage`` against the project state root. The function completed
``scope`` — running only ``scope``'s validator — stamped a valid contract
fingerprint, and marked ``solve`` and ``review`` ``skipped``.

Nothing was hand-forged. The resulting ``PIPELINE_STATE.json`` passes
``_vertical_completion_record``'s structural audit exactly, because that audit
checks an early completion is *internally consistent* and this one was minted
by the real primitive. ``vertical_completion_certificate_status`` answered
``{"ok": True}``. The math had in fact been done and certified, but nothing in
this path required that; the same three calls close any project at stage 1.

The word "final" lived only in ``final_stage_completion_decision``, in the
Manager layer, which a caller reaches this primitive without passing through.

Two changes, because a write-side lock does nothing about state already on disk:

* ``complete_final_stage`` refuses off the final stage unless the caller passes
  ``allow_early_completion``, which the Manager supplies for ``direct``
  workflow mode — the one arrangement where stopping early is a real outcome;
* ``vertical_completion_certificate_status`` re-checks the same condition at
  read time, so a record like run 13's is rejected wherever it is read.

This is a lock, not a signature. ``completed_by`` is free text (run 13 wrote
``"manager-repair"``, a string in no source file) and the fingerprint is
recomputable by anyone who can read the framework. A caller determined to pass
the argument still can. What is closed is the accident-shaped path: reaching
for a function whose name promised a check it did not perform.
