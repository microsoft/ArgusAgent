# Developing an idea through experiments

## What Experiment should establish

Turn the selected idea into a real implementation and develop it until
representative evidence supports a scoped thesis with scientific value.
Building the method and running the experiments happen in this one stage:
the experimental design changes in place as evidence arrives; it is never
a frozen plan handed down from somewhere else.
Judge results the way a strong experimentalist does — against baselines,
effect sizes, and the question at hand, in context. Before each scientific
comparison, state the capability, a competing explanation, and the control
that separates them. Adapt the design using development evidence; freeze the
comparison before held-out confirmation. Do not impose universal success
thresholds or an immutable global plan. Report what the evidence supports.
A credible improvement in any meaningful dimension can carry the
contribution; the target is a result that a top reviewer would remember,
not a complete-looking experiment matrix.

## How to develop the evidence

1. Read the research notes in `RESEARCH_NOTES.md` and trace every load-bearing thesis element to concrete
   code, configuration, data, outputs, and information boundaries.
2. Inspect the strongest relevant official implementations. Clone and run a
   fixed public revision when compiling, adapting, or comparing its code; reuse
   maintained components instead of reimplementing them from a paper summary.
   Also survey the released code of recent papers in the same area — including
   ones the experiments will not compare against — and read the high-quality
   ones as reference implementations: how they structure the training and
   evaluation code, which libraries they build on, and how they handle the
   details a paper summary glosses over. Borrowing a proven pattern from a
   strong recent codebase beats inventing one.
   For training and inference infrastructure this is the rule, not a
   preference: RL post-training, preference optimization such as DPO,
   distributed training, and serving all go through an established framework
   (veRL, OpenRLHF, TRL, LLaMA-Factory, vLLM, or the released baseline's own
   stack). A hand-rolled training loop or serving path is slower, subtly
   wrong in ways that contaminate every result built on it, and convinces no
   reviewer — write custom infrastructure only when that infrastructure is
   itself the contribution being studied.
3. Set up a clean project-local environment before writing method code: the
   project gets its own virtual environment on the system interpreter, with
   dependencies installed and pinned there — never in the framework
   environment, and never inherited from another project's leftovers. Install
   the complete toolchain the method actually needs and confirm each piece
   runs: compilers, the CUDA toolkit and driver-compatible libraries,
   profilers, and domain toolkits — kernel-optimization work in particular
   depends on many of these (nvcc, Triton, CUTLASS, Nsight and friends), and a
   missing or mismatched one quietly invalidates every measurement built on
   top of it.
4. Implement the method and baseline through real entry points under comparable
   data, compute, information, and evaluator access. Build the strongest
   faithful version of the idea, not the easiest version that can pass a local
   check.
5. Run only the smallest engineering checks needed to establish imports,
   shapes, branches, numerical behavior, and end-to-end wiring, then run a
   known detectable positive control through the same evaluator path.
6. Develop the method with real models or systems and the strongest
   same-information baselines required by the claim. Prefer existing public or
   official benchmarks with their released tasks, splits, protocols, and scorers.
   Small custom benchmarks are allowed under the cost-aware benchmark policy
   below, including as scientific evidence for a scoped mechanism claim.
   Choose models for task competence and claim scope, not release date.
7. Keep every run reproducible from its code, explicit configuration, command,
   and raw output.
8. Treat weak results as optimization signals. Change the method,
   implementation, benchmark, baseline, controls, or scale when development
   evidence identifies a concrete reason — the design and the runs live
   together here precisely so this revision is cheap.
9. Separate small engineering diagnostics from claim-bearing experiments.
   Stop repeating micro-benchmarks once they no longer change the next decision.
10. Use held-out confirmation after method and evaluation choices stabilize.

Choose sample counts from coverage of independent items and the precision
needed for the claim; explain the choice in the research notes. Repeat stochastic
runs when seed variation could change the conclusion. Rerunning deterministic
comparisons adds no independent evidence.

Scale the evidence to the claim, not to the first configuration that ran. A
thesis about language models in general is tested across families and sizes;
a thesis about a phenomenon needs enough independent items, worlds, or tasks
that a reviewer cannot attribute it to a handful of templates; a thesis about a
mechanism needs the matched ablation that isolates it. Use available hardware
and cached models for the comparisons that resolve the question. A
development panel sized for quick iteration is not the claim-bearing
evaluation; once method and evaluation settle, run the comparison at the scale
the claim needs and say in the research notes why that scale is enough.

### Cost-aware benchmark policy

Use established benchmarks by default for broad task-performance claims and
large-scale evaluation. Small custom benchmarks are allowed when they consume
no API calls or only a small amount within the existing authorized budget.
Examples include locally generated factorial controls for token identity,
position, layer, or activation amplitude, evaluated on a local model.
They may support the mechanism they actually test, not just implementation
smoke checks.

Before dispatch, account for the total API calls and tokens across generation,
labeling, evaluation, judging, and planned repetitions, as well as local compute.
A small item count alone does not establish low cost. Expanding such a benchmark
requires reassessing the total workload; the small-experiment exception does not
authorize a large API-backed synthetic campaign. Existing project-specific
restrictions, including a ban on paid APIs or custom tasks, still apply.

Make custom task construction, label derivation, splits, controls, and scoring
explicit and reproducible. Execute the experiments and preserve their actual
results. A custom mechanism test must not masquerade as official benchmark
coverage or replace established evaluation needed for a broad performance claim.

### Planner scale assessment after a passing experiment

Reviewer acceptance establishes that the current experiment meets its
requirements; it does not by itself establish adequate research scale.
Before advancing to Paper, Planner inspects the accepted results and actual
configuration in its next normal planning turn. Compare training coverage,
independent evaluation items, task or template families, model or agent scales,
repetitions, and uncertainty with the operator's research objective. Identify
which dimensions matter for that objective rather than imposing universal
sample counts or requiring every possible benchmark setting.

If coverage or precision is insufficient, stay in Experiment and assign an
incremental expansion of the existing implementation. Reuse valid completed
results and the evaluator; prefer relevant released benchmark splits, task
settings, training data, models, or repetitions. Apply the cost-aware benchmark
policy to any small custom experiment and its expansion. Do not count repeated
identical runs as new independent evidence. Make sample counts configurable and validate against the
selected configuration, not a hard-coded pilot count. A minimum count is not
an exact-count requirement.

Keep held-out data out of training and method selection. Expanding training
creates a new checkpoint and comparison with fresh held-out confirmation;
preserve the earlier results separately rather than silently pooling them.
Use measured throughput and available resources to size the next run. Surface
an actual access or budget blocker instead of quietly shrinking the objective.

If scale is sufficient, state the evidence-based rationale in the existing
research plan and Planner REASON, and request `ADVANCE_TO_STAGE=paper` with the
writing task. Manager applies the transition. If insufficient, leave that
field unset and explain the expansion in the task. Repeat this judgment after
the expanded experiment is reviewed, not by rerunning an unchanged inspection.
Do not replace this check with a narrower paper claim or a standalone
validation-only mission.

When the decisive comparison goes against the mechanism, because a matched
ablation or the strongest same-information baseline wins on fresh evidence,
the next move is not another variant of the same objective. Return to the
evidence and ask what it does establish: often the evaluation built to test
the mechanism is itself the finding, or the refutation is the result the field
needs, provided that evaluation is at claim scale. Re-derive the thesis,
confirm it on untouched data, and carry that thesis into Paper. A further repair round
on the same mechanism needs a concrete, diagnosed cause; repeated development
on the same panels is not confirmation, however many cycles it took.

Plan only on resources that are actually in hand. Human participants, ethics
approval, paid annotation, credentials, external services, or compute the
operator has not supplied cannot be scheduled as work in an autonomous
campaign; raise the need once, then design the claim around what can be
executed here. Never stand in for missing evidence with fabricated,
placeholder, or projected results: not in the runs, not in the research notes, and
never in a manuscript.

Choose benchmarks that expose the method's mechanism and real advantage rather
than convenient saturated tasks. Inspect the existing benchmark's label
provenance, shortcut opportunities, and ability to distinguish the claimed
mechanism; if unsuitable, select another established benchmark or a small
custom experiment permitted by the cost-aware benchmark policy. Follow surprising positive evidence when it
reveals a stronger contribution, then confirm it on untouched data. Keep
relevant losses visible internally, but do not let defensive edge-case coverage
replace the main result.

Check real external, numerical, persistence, and security boundaries. Inside
the controlled implementation, trust established invariants. Do not add
redundant guards, fallback chains, reports, wrappers, or abstractions merely to
make the project look robust.

Do not freeze a global experiment plan, reopen Idea selection, hide relevant
losses, or present unfinished development as a negative result; a negative or
boundary thesis is a paper only when its evidence is as complete as a positive
one would need.

## When the evidence is ready for Paper

Enter Paper after Reviewer accepts the experiment and Planner's post-result
scale assessment finds its coverage and precision sufficient for the objective.
The evidence must improve at least one scientifically meaningful dimension.
Do not require a hard numeric margin,
wins on every headline metric, or dominance over every strong baseline. Keep
uncertainty, relevant losses, and tradeoffs visible, and scope the thesis to
what improved. Manager alone advances the stage.

## Research notes

When the entry bar is met, replace the research notes at project-root
`RESEARCH_NOTES.md`, beginning with `# Research notes — Experiment stage`.
Include the thesis, winning comparisons, strongest
baseline, relevant limitations, confirmed figures/data, and minimum
reproducibility pointers needed by Paper. Organize it around the claim
and its evidence, not around the order in which experiments ran.
