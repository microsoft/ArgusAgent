"""Speedrun-vertical stage definitions.

A vertical for **quantitative optimization missions** with a wall-time
budget — kernel optimization, training-script speedrun, autoresearch
benchmarks like ``nanochat_autoresearch`` and SOL-ExecBench.

There is no paper. There is one number to minimize (or maximize) under
a hard wall-clock budget, scored by a fixed harness, evaluated over N
seeds. The verdict is mechanical, not narrative.

The 4 stages:

1. **setup**: pin the target (script to attack), the harness
   (``solutions/lib.py``), the reference baseline scores, and the
   hardware budget. Output: ``mission/SETUP.md``.

2. **optimize**: produce attempts under ``attempts/<name>/train.py``,
   each a self-contained training script that fits the harness
   contract. Output: at least one such script per round.

3. **measure**: run each attempt for N seeds, score via the harness,
   record per-seed rows in ``attempts/<name>/results.csv``. Output:
   one row per (attempt × seed).

4. **report**: aggregate attempt × repeat rows into a single
   ``RESULTS.md`` table comparing the mission metric / wall time vs the
   reference baselines, with honest CI. No prose beyond a one-paragraph
   "what changed and what didn't" per attempt.

Compared to the research vertical (which has 8 stages, paper artifacts,
literature gates, reviewer checklists per stage), this vertical is
deliberately *small* — most of the supervisor work happens inside the
single ``optimize`` stage where engineer iterates code, and the
mechanical ``measure`` + ``report`` stages take seconds. This is the
right shape for "the agent writes code, the harness scores it" tasks
where there is nothing to write up.

#
# These feed ``argus_skill.skills.stage_machine`` (the markdown checklist
# that drives the planner/engineer/reviewer round loop) via the optional-hook
# contract in ``argus_skill.verticals._base``. The research vertical re-exports
# the paper floor; the speedrun vertical declares its OWN 4-stage, metric-
# agnostic checklist instead — there is no paper, one number to move the right
# way under a fixed wall-clock budget, whatever that number is (val bpb, kernel
# speedup/SOL, latency, accuracy, …).
#
# The items below are GENERIC across optimization missions: the deliverable/
# eval contract is pinned at ``setup``, the candidate is produced and screened
# at ``optimize``, the repeat-mean / budget measurement happens at ``measure``,
# and the head-to-head baseline comparison is the ``report``. Mission-specific
# nouns (the editable file, the scorer, the metric name, the named baseline)
# come from the operator objective / MISSION.md, not hard-coded here.

            "- As REVIEWER, you are also the INNOVATION COACH, and you run a "
            "BASIN-HOPPING + CO-TUNING search — NOT a greedy single-point "
            "hill-climb. Your job is to keep the verified floor safe while pushing "
            "the search into structurally NEW regions of the design space. "
            "Specifically:\n"
            "  * GLOBAL BEST vs ACTIVE LINE: the lowest-ever VERIFIER-measured mean "
            "metric is the GLOBAL BEST — keep it snapshotted and NEVER lose that "
            "floor. But do NOT demand that every experiment restart from the "
            "global-best SHA; that greedy re-anchoring is exactly what traps the "
            "loop in a local optimum. Track a separate ACTIVE LINE the engineer is "
            "currently developing, which may sit slightly ABOVE the global best "
            "while it matures.\n"
            "  * MATURATION WINDOW: a structural / optimizer / architecture change "
            "usually scores WORSE on round 1 because its supporting hyperparameters "
            "(LR, init, warmup, schedule) do not fit yet, and only wins after 2-4 "
            "rounds of CO-TUNING. Give every new direction a maturation window of "
            "several rounds before judging it; NEVER declare a bold direction dead "
            "after a single losing round — that is the central mistake.\n"
            "  * COMBINE coordinated changes: when a structural change and the "
            "hyperparameters that support it express ONE idea, accept them as ONE "
            "candidate. Do not force one-knob-at-a-time on a method-level move.\n"
            "  * BASIN-HOP when nibbling: if the last ~3 rounds each improved the "
            "global best by <0.001 (or failed), the recipe is in a LOCAL OPTIMUM. "
            "Stop approving further perturbations of it and, in next_action, DEMAND "
            "a NEW active line from a STRUCTURALLY DIFFERENT region — a different "
            "depth/width trade, a different attention scheme, a different optimizer "
            "regime, a different token/step-budget split, a curriculum, a different "
            "normalization/residual scheme. Develop THAT for several rounds EVEN IF "
            "it is temporarily worse than the global best; you are exploring, not "
            "climbing.\n"
            "  * REVERT means revert the ACTIVE LINE's last step — not snap all the "
            "way back to the global-best SHA for the next idea. Always snapshot the "
            "global best so exploration never loses ground, but let the next idea "
            "continue from where the active line is.\n"
            "  * BIAS TO BOLD: at least HALF of your next_action recommendations "
            "must be structural / method-level explorations (new architecture, "
            "optimizer, or training paradigm), not regularizer/init/LR nibbles — the "
            "nibbles are nearly exhausted and the remaining gains live in a "
            "different region of the design space.\n"
            "  * NEVER accept 'no changes / objective complete' while budget remains "
            "and the metric can still drop, and treat a properly measured-and-"
            "reverted bold experiment as GOOD process, not failure. Do NOT flag "
