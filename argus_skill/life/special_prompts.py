"""Special prompts — operator-authored, machine-specific standing directives.

The framework hardcodes general, portable guidance (role contracts, pipeline
stages, skills). But every physical box has its own *house rules* that the
operator — not the framework — owns: "this machine reclaims idle GPUs, free
the keep-alive before training", "scratch lives on /mnt/fast", "never touch
/data/raw", and so on. Baking those into the package would be wrong; they are
deployment facts, not framework behaviour.

A **special prompt** is exactly that channel. The operator drops Markdown
files into ``~/.argus-skill/special_prompts/`` and their contents are injected
verbatim, high in every agent's runtime context, ahead of general guidance.
They are standing instructions: the agent treats them as authoritative house
rules and follows them like a human operator would.

Files are read in sorted filename order, so a numeric prefix (``10-...``,
``20-...``) controls precedence. An optional tiny frontmatter block may set
``scope: paper`` (or ``scope: nonpaper``); mission type comes from the resolved
vertical, never from objective keywords. The directory is operator-owned and
lives outside the repo so it never gets committed.
