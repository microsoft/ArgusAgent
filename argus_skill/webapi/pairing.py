"""Pairing a phone with a LAN-exposed web UI.

The API binds ``127.0.0.1`` by default, which is right for the machine running
the daemon and useless from a phone. Exposing it is a one-flag change
(``--web-host 0.0.0.0``) and the token that protects it was, until now, purely
advisory: the help text said to set ``ARGUS_SKILL_WEB_TOKEN``, and nothing
happened if you didn't. The result was an unauthenticated control surface for
an agent with shell access, one flag away.

This module closes that and makes the secure path the easy one:

* A non-loopback bind **always** ends up authenticated. If no token is
  configured, one is minted for the run rather than serving in the clear.
  ``ARGUS_SKILL_WEB_ALLOW_INSECURE=1`` is the explicit opt-out, for operators
  who front the API with their own auth.
* The reachable URL — token included — is printed with a QR code, so pairing a
  phone is a scan instead of typing a 32-character secret on a touch keyboard.
  The web client stores the token on arrival, so the installed PWA stays
  authenticated afterwards.

Rendering the QR needs the optional ``argus-skill[qr]`` extra; without it the
URL is still printed in full.
