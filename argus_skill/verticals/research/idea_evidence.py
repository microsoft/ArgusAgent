"""Idea evidence for research work: what a probe actually established.

Research has the same failure mode kernel work has, with higher stakes. A
pilot that under-performs looks like a refuted hypothesis, and an early idea
judged against a publication bar looks like a bad idea. Both readings kill
work that was never actually tested.

The four-state model and its invariants come from
:mod:`argus_skill.core.evidence_status`. What this module adds is the research
vocabulary, and three rules that follow from it:

* **An inadequate implementation is not a disproof.** ``implementation`` is
  not a refuting failure class. Before a negative result may be called
  ``refuted``, someone has to establish that the thing being tested was built
  competently — otherwise the finding is about the code, not the idea.
* **An under-powered pilot is inconclusive, not negative.** ``statistical_power``
  sits in the non-idea set: N=1, single-seed, or noise-dominated runs may
  inform the next probe, but they may not settle the premise.
* **Prior art is a replanning signal, not a refutation.** Finding that an
  existing paper covers the idea changes what to work on next. It is not
  evidence that the premise is false, and recording it as such loses the
  distinction between "someone did this" and "this does not work".

``premise`` is versioned deliberately: redefining the premise starts a fresh
evidence record, so a conclusion about the old premise cannot silently be
carried over to the new one.
