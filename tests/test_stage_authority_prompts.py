"""Guard tests: pipeline stage-transition authority belongs to the Manager only.

These lock the prompt surgery (Step 4 of the stage-authority change) that removed
every instruction telling the engineer / reviewer / planner to write pipeline
stage state or call ``rollback_stage`` directly. The Manager is the sole
writer of ``current_stage`` after initial state creation; the others only advise.
