"""Deterministic leaderboard fold for an agent team.

The Curator deterministically folds teammate result shards into a per-target
leaderboard. It is pure single-writer code—no model call or agent bookkeeping.
``objective_block`` shows a fresh teammate what has already been tried so it can
build on the best instead of repeating exhausted breadth.

Generality red line: the metric and its direction are the only operator-specific
inputs, and both are DATA — the metric arrives in the shard (see
``teammate_entry``), the direction is an env flag. Nothing SOL/box-specific lives
here.
