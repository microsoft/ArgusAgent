"""Every selectable vertical must have a final stage the Reviewer can certify.

A vertical whose LAST stage has no checklist items and no stage checks renders
as "Checklist not applicable: this stage explicitly declares
`checklist_optional`". The Reviewer is then told there is nothing to verify at
the only place completion is decided, so "done" carries no vertical-owned
meaning at all. ``software`` shipped in exactly that state.

This guard is about the FINAL stage only. Intermediate stages are legitimately
optional — a vertical is free to let work skip straight past them.
