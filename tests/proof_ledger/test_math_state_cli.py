"""The write path into the kernel, and the tier an agent cannot type.

The kernel could express a project's beliefs and derive what they added up to,
and nothing could put anything into it. This covers the module that closes that
gap, and it is mostly adversarial for one reason: ``MathState.add_evidence``
accepts every tier, because a legitimate producer of each has to reach it. The
tier is therefore decided by the command surface, and the property that makes
the whole schema mean anything is that an agent's command cannot choose one
that confers kernel status.

That property is asserted three ways below — as the constant, as the behaviour
of the funnel every command writes through, and as a sweep of the source that
fails if a later flag routes around either. The third is the one that matters
after this PR: the first two would still pass if somebody added ``--tier`` next
to them.
