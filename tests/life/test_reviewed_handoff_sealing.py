"""Regression test: the round loop must SEAL the Reviewer half of the packet.

``record_engineer_handoff`` has always been wired (round_execution.py), so
``round-NNNN-engineer.json`` appeared on disk. ``record_reviewed_handoff`` —
which writes ``round-NNNN.json`` with ``kind="round_reviewed_handoff"`` and
``producer_role="reviewer"`` — had **zero production callers**. Two things
were dead as a result:

1. ``_latest_unassessed_review_for_current_stage`` (life/supervisor) scans for
   exactly that file, so the framework's only non-circular campaign-level
   stage-advance trigger could never fire. No mission in any vertical whose
   completion gate is not ``certified`` could leave its first stage.
2. ``TaskFrontier.apply`` is reached only from ``record_reviewed_handoff``, so
   the Reviewer's frontier reports never advanced the persisted frontier.

The seal is gated on ``review_source == "reviewer"``: the packet declares
itself independent evidence, so an Engineer self-review must never produce
one, or the Engineer would certify its own stage transition.

- argus_skill/engineer/round_settlement.py — the seal
- argus_skill/life/context_packet.py — ``record_reviewed_handoff``
- argus_skill/engineer/round_self_review.py — the self-review ``_settle_round``
  caller whose verdicts carry ``review_source="engineer_self_review"``
