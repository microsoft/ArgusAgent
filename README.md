## What is Argus?

Most agents are optimized for one conversation or one coding turn. Argus is built for work that lasts: it keeps state, separates execution from judgment, and resumes from verified progress instead of starting over.

| Capability | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Persistent state** | Tasks, checkpoints, decisions, Skills, and evidence survive sessions and runtime upgrades. |
| **Independent review** | Execution and verification stay separate; normal rounds end with a Reviewer judgment. |
| **Four-role runtime** | Manager, Planner, Engineer, and Reviewer have distinct authority and responsibilities. |
| **Real tool use** | Agents work through files, terminals, experiments, APIs, and inspectable artifacts. |
| **Domain extensibility** | Verticals can define custom stages, tools, evidence requirements, and completion standards. |
| **Multiple backends** | Run with GitHub Copilot CLI, Pi, Codex CLI, Claude Code, OpenCode, Grok Build, Qoder, or DeepSeek Harness. |

## Runtime model

| | Authority | Responsibility |
|---:|---|---|
| `01` | **Manager · Control** | Interprets operator intent, selects the workflow, and owns stage transitions. |
| `02` | **Planner · Direction** | Chooses the next high-value task and defines the evidence it must produce. |
| `03` | **Engineer · Execution** | Implements, researches, runs experiments, and creates inspectable artifacts. |
| `04` | **Reviewer · Verification** | Independently checks correctness, evidence, limitations, and completion. |

A project can stop, resume, survive a runtime replacement, and continue from its latest verified position.

**Native backends:** `GitHub Copilot CLI` · `Pi` · `OpenAI Codex CLI` · `Claude Code` · `OpenCode` · `Grok Build` · `Qoder` · `DeepSeek Harness`

**Harbor evaluation:** Harbor Framework can invoke the complete bounded Argus
Manager/Planner/Engineer/Reviewer runtime as a custom agent. See
**[Harbor integration](https://github.com/lbx154/Argus/blob/main/docs/harbor.md)**.

**Coding-agent plugin:** use the packaged MCP bridge and host-specific Skills
without changing the core runtime. See **[Plugin quick start](https://github.com/lbx154/Argus/blob/main/docs/plugin.md)**.

## Quick Install

Choose the section for your operating system. Do not mix commands between
platforms. All platforms need Node.js **22.12+** from
[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and one authenticated Agent CLI.
Reuse the CLI you already work in; Argus does not require a separate account.
Docker is not required for a normal Argus installation; it is only an optional
prerequisite for the separate Harbor evaluation integration.

> [!TIP]
> **Recommended: let the Code Agent you already use install and verify Argus.**
> Copy the prompt in the Agent-assisted section below. The manual commands remain
> available for users who prefer to install each step themselves.

| Agent CLI | Backend | Install | Authenticate |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `copilot` | `npm install -g @github/copilot` | `copilot login` |
| OpenAI Codex CLI | `codex` | `npm install -g @openai/codex@latest` | `codex login` |
| Claude Code | `claude` | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` | Run `claude`, then `/login` |
| Pi | `pi` | `npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` | Run `pi`, then `/login` |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | [Official install](https://opencode.ai/docs/) | `opencode auth login` |
| Grok Build | `grok` | [Official install](https://x.ai/cli) | `grok login` |
| Qoder CLI | `qoder` | `npm install -g @qoder-ai/qodercli` | `qodercli login` |
| DeepSeek Harness | `dsh` | `npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh` | Configure `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` or the dsh Models page |

The public preview is installed directly from the current GitHub archive until
the first PyPI release is published.

### Recommended: Agent-assisted installation

Send this prompt to an already installed Code Agent:

```text
Read https://github.com/lbx154/Argus/blob/main/docs/agent-install.md and install
Argus using the section for this operating system. Prefer the Agent CLI running
this conversation as the Argus backend. Do not create a venv on Windows or
macOS; keep the documented venv on Linux. Run setup through its real Agent-turn
smoke test, then run `argus doctor --deep --advisor auto`. Before account login,
sudo, or global configuration changes, explain why and wait for approval. Never
ask me to paste a password, token, or API key into the conversation.
```

The agent follows the **[installation execution contract](https://github.com/lbx154/Argus/blob/main/docs/agent-install.md)**.

### Windows 10/11 — direct pip, no virtual environment

Install Python 3.11+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
and select **Add Python to PATH** in the installer. Then open a new PowerShell:

```powershell
py --version
node --version
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
py -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall "argus-skill @ https://github.com/microsoft/ArgusAgent/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"
$Scripts = py -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_path('scripts'))"
$Argus = Join-Path $Scripts "argus.exe"
if (-not (Test-Path $Argus)) { throw "Argus entry point not found at $Argus" }
$env:Path = "$Scripts;$env:Path"
& $Argus --version
& $Argus --setup
& $Argus doctor --deep --advisor auto
& $Argus --status
& $Argus
```

Calling `$Argus` proves setup is not accidentally using another stale
installation. `$env:Path` also makes plain `argus` available in the current
PowerShell. The troubleshooting section covers persistent PATH repair.

`argus doctor` is an active repair command. By default it launches an installed
Agent CLI in the real Argus directories with tools enabled, lets the Agent
inspect and fix the machine, then reruns deterministic checks. Use
`argus doctor --advisor none --verify` for a no-model verification.
The active repair may take several minutes because it performs a real Agent
turn; it is not a quick version check.

Windows currently supports installation, Manager chat, pairing, Web/TUI,
terminal-scoped daemon control, and native durable subagents. On native Windows,
a detached worker owns direct or supervised long commands, persists registry and
log state, and uses bounded process-tree cleanup; WSL2 remains optional rather
than required for this path. The Windows Desktop installer is documented separately in
**[Windows Desktop](https://github.com/lbx154/Argus/blob/main/docs/windows-desktop.md)**.

### macOS — managed command install, no manual virtual environment

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if needed,
then:

```bash
uv --version
node --version
uv tool install --force --python 3.12 \
  "argus-skill @ https://github.com/microsoft/ArgusAgent/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"
ARGUS_BIN="$(uv tool dir --bin)/argus"
test -x "$ARGUS_BIN"
"$ARGUS_BIN" --version
uv tool update-shell
"$ARGUS_BIN" --setup
"$ARGUS_BIN" doctor --deep --advisor auto
"$ARGUS_BIN" --status
"$ARGUS_BIN"
```

`ARGUS_BIN` works immediately even when uv's tool directory was not previously
on PATH. `uv tool update-shell` makes plain `argus` available in a new terminal.
`uv tool` already owns the isolated environment; do not create another venv.

### Linux — isolated source venv

Linux servers keep an explicit venv so Python, CUDA tooling, and long-running
process ownership remain reproducible. Install Python 3.11+, Git, Node.js
22.12+, and your distribution's `python3-venv` package first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ArgusAgent.git "$HOME/ArgusAgent"
cd "$HOME/ArgusAgent"
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .
ARGUS_BIN="$HOME/ArgusAgent/.venv/bin/argus"
"$ARGUS_BIN" --version
"$ARGUS_BIN" --setup
"$ARGUS_BIN" doctor --deep --advisor auto
"$ARGUS_BIN" --status
"$ARGUS_BIN"
```

Do not rely on a globally installed `argus` on Linux. In a new shell, use
`$HOME/ArgusAgent/.venv/bin/argus` (or activate that venv explicitly). If venv
creation reports that `ensurepip` is unavailable, install the distribution's
`python3-venv` package and rerun the command.

### Backend notes

Use `copilot`, `pi`, `codex`, `claude`, `opencode`, `grok`, `qoder`, or `dsh`
for `--backend`. Setup adopts a model from the selected CLI's own catalog when
one is available; otherwise it keeps that CLI's native default. It does not
inject an OpenAI model id into Claude Code, Pi, OpenCode, Grok, Qoder, or dsh.
If you have an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, setup installs Pi when needed and
configures it directly:

```bash
ARGUS_SETUP_API_KEY=... argus --setup --non-interactive \
  --api-url https://api.example.com/v1 \
  --api-model model-id
```

For Grok Build, install and authenticate the official xAI CLI first:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
grok login
argus --setup --non-interactive --backend grok
```

`XAI_API_KEY` is also supported for headless environments. Argus uses Grok's
native headless JSON stream, resumes sessions by ID, and keeps role prompts out
of process arguments.
In PowerShell, use a backtick instead of `\` for line continuation.

#### Choosing a provider on the multi-provider CLIs

Pi and OpenCode are provider-agnostic fronts: which account they bill depends on
what you authenticated them against (a native DeepSeek key, Anthropic, Azure, a
local vLLM, a Copilot proxy). Argus passes your configured model id straight
through, so a bare id like `deepseek-chat` is resolved by the CLI itself.

Name the provider when a bare id is ambiguous or when the CLI requires it:

```bash
# Pi — only needed when two authenticated catalogs carry the same model id
export ARGUS_SKILL_PI_PROVIDER=deepseek

# OpenCode — required: `opencode run --model` only accepts provider/id
export ARGUS_SKILL_OPENCODE_PROVIDER=deepseek
```

Both are also settable from the cockpit `/config` view, and persist across
restarts once set there.

`argus --doctor` reads the CLI's authenticated catalog and tells you when the
configured provider is not one you hold a key for, or when a model id you
selected is not on offer.

Use `argus --config-help` to inspect each role's effective model and where it
came from. Catalog commands are backend-specific, for example
`pi --list-models`, `opencode auth list`, and `qodercli --list-models`.

Full details, including the breaking change for Pi deployments that relied on
the old implicit `github-copilot` prefix: **[backend providers](https://github.com/lbx154/Argus/blob/main/docs/backend-providers.md)**.

### Launch

Windows and macOS can use `argus` after PATH setup. On Linux, replace `argus`
below with `$HOME/ArgusAgent/.venv/bin/argus` unless the venv is active.

```bash
argus
```

```bash
argus doctor                         # Agent-driven inspection and repair
argus doctor --advisor none --verify # deterministic verification, no model call
argus --status                       # inspect the current runtime
```

## Interfaces

### Windows Desktop

The Windows x64 source tree includes an Electron host that supervises a frozen
copy of the same Argus runtime and opens the existing Web cockpit—there is no
separate Desktop fork of Manager, Workbench, or the WebAPI. Source setup,
security boundaries, verification, and packaging commands are documented in
**[Windows Desktop](https://github.com/lbx154/Argus/blob/main/docs/windows-desktop.md)**.

### Terminal cockpit

```bash
argus
```

Use the terminal cockpit to talk to the Manager, follow live work, inspect state, and resume projects.
Without an explicit `--port`, Argus reuses a compatible backend or selects the
first available port starting at `8799` when another program or stale backend
occupies it. On Windows, a plain `argus` launch also opens the Web UI; use
`argus --no-open` for the terminal cockpit only.

### Web UI

Start Argus and open the Web UI in your default browser:

```bash
argus --web
```

Preferred address: [http://127.0.0.1:8799](http://127.0.0.1:8799); Argus advances
to the next available port when needed.

The Web UI follows the browser language on first launch and supports English
and Simplified Chinese. Use the language button in the session sidebar to
switch; the selection is saved in the browser.

```bash
argus --web --web-port 8800  # use another port
```

#### Remote server over SSH

On the server:

```bash
argus --web
```

On your computer:

```bash
ssh -L 8799:127.0.0.1:8799 user@server
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8799](http://127.0.0.1:8799) locally.

<details>
<summary><strong>Direct LAN access</strong></summary>

A non-loopback bind is always protected by a bearer token. If
`ARGUS_SKILL_WEB_TOKEN` is set it is used; otherwise one is minted for that run:

```bash
argus --web --web-host 0.0.0.0 --web-port 8799
```

This prints the address other devices can reach, the token, and a QR code.
Set the token yourself to keep one across restarts:

```bash
export ARGUS_SKILL_WEB_TOKEN="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
```

To serve without a token — only behind your own authenticating proxy — set
`ARGUS_SKILL_WEB_ALLOW_INSECURE=1`.

</details>

### From a phone

Telegram, Feishu/Lark, and the web UI all work from a phone. The two chat bots
dial out, so a daemon behind NAT needs no tunnel and no public URL:

```bash
# Feishu / Lark — WebSocket long connection, no request URL to configure
pip install 'argus-skill[feishu]'
export ARGUS_SKILL_ENABLE_FEISHU=1
export ARGUS_SKILL_FEISHU_APP_ID=cli_xxx ARGUS_SKILL_FEISHU_APP_SECRET=xxx

# Telegram
export ARGUS_SKILL_ENABLE_TELEGRAM=1
export ARGUS_SKILL_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=... ARGUS_SKILL_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=...
```

Both bots serve the same commands (`/add`, `/status`, `/nudge`, `/backlog`, …).
The web UI is installable to the home screen and pairs by scanning the QR code
printed by `argus --web --web-host 0.0.0.0`.

See **[docs/mobile.md](https://github.com/lbx154/Argus/blob/main/docs/mobile.md)** for the full setup.

## Advanced usage

Argus is designed to be changed, not merely configured.

### Autonomy level

The default `pragmatic` mode handles recoverable engineering choices—timeouts, failed tests, benchmark sizing, and technical routes—without interrupting you. It asks only for credentials, more spending, irreversible/outward-facing actions, or changes to an operator-owned acceptance boundary.

```bash
export ARGUS_SKILL_AUTONOMY_MODE=cautious    # ask on every explicit question
export ARGUS_SKILL_AUTONOMY_MODE=pragmatic   # default: recover technical issues
export ARGUS_SKILL_AUTONOMY_MODE=autonomous  # maximize reversible execution
```

The Web configuration view and `/config` expose the same setting.

### Adapt the runtime

If you are an agent enthusiast, deploy Argus locally and make the complete loop fit the way you work. Tune role prompts, workflow boundaries, review policy, tools, and operating conventions; connect your own infrastructure; preserve the behavior you care about with tests.

### Build your own Vertical

A Vertical gives your field its own stages, Skills, datasets, tools, evidence expectations, evaluation methods, and completion criteria. Planning and review can then follow the real standards of your domain instead of a generic process.

The `math` vertical is the worked example: three stages, a content-addressed
evidence store, Lean-backed mechanical verification, and an explicit rule for
which kind of check is allowed to settle which kind of question. See
**[mathematical research](https://github.com/lbx154/Argus/blob/main/docs/research-mathematics.md)**.

### Use another agent as the outer layer

GitHub Copilot, Pi, Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Grok Build, OpenClaw, or Hermes can be the environment from which you invoke Argus, inspect its state, operate its local CLI or Web/API surface, and continue improving the deployment.

- **Native Argus backends:** GitHub Copilot CLI, Pi, Codex CLI, Claude Code, OpenCode, Grok Build, Qoder, DeepSeek Harness
- **External agent operators:** OpenClaw, Hermes, or any agent that can use a shell or HTTP API

For durable missions, install or adapt the portable
[`argus-runtime-orchestration` Agent Skill](integrations/agent-skills/argus-runtime-orchestration/SKILL.md).
It defines the two-party operator model, the active `Needs you` intervention loop,
host-specific adapters, evidence boundaries, and closeout checks.

Useful entry points:

```bash
argus doctor
argus --status
argus --web
```

The most capable setup is often an Argus instance deliberately adapted to your own ambitious field and way of working.

## Update

Windows:

```powershell
py -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall "argus-skill @ https://github.com/microsoft/ArgusAgent/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"
$Argus = Join-Path (py -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_path('scripts'))") "argus.exe"
& $Argus --version
& $Argus doctor --advisor none --verify
```

macOS:

```bash
uv tool install --force --python 3.12 \
  "argus-skill @ https://github.com/microsoft/ArgusAgent/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"
"$(uv tool dir --bin)/argus" --version
"$(uv tool dir --bin)/argus" doctor --advisor none --verify
```

Linux source checkout:

```bash
"$HOME/ArgusAgent/.venv/bin/argus" update
"$HOME/ArgusAgent/.venv/bin/argus" --version
"$HOME/ArgusAgent/.venv/bin/argus" doctor --advisor none --verify
```

The Linux source command refuses dirty or detached checkouts, fast-forwards the
configured upstream, and refreshes the editable installation when the revision
changes. Argus detects stale local WebAPI and daemon processes and replaces them
at a controlled task boundary. Update verification is deterministic and does
not spend a model call.

## Uninstall

```powershell
# Windows
py -m pip uninstall argus-skill
```

```bash
# macOS
uv tool uninstall argus-skill
```

On Linux, stop Argus, preserve any work you need, then remove the
`$HOME/ArgusAgent` checkout and its `.venv`. Package removal intentionally leaves
runtime state under `$HOME/.argus-skill` untouched on every platform; delete
that directory only when you also want to remove projects, configuration, and
logs.

## Installation troubleshooting

- Confirm which executable the shell is using: `Get-Command argus -All` on
  PowerShell, or `type -a argus` on macOS/Linux. Its `argus --version` release
  id should change after an update.
- On macOS, use `"$(uv tool dir --bin)/argus"` immediately. Run
  `uv tool update-shell` once and open a new terminal for plain `argus`.
- On Windows, recover the exact Scripts directory with
  `$Scripts = py -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_path('scripts'))"`.
  Add it to the current window with `$env:Path = "$Scripts;$env:Path"`. For new
  windows, use the Python installer’s **Modify** action and enable
  **Add Python to PATH** rather than creating a venv.
- On Linux, use `$HOME/ArgusAgent/.venv/bin/argus`; a global `argus` may be an older
  installation. Install `python3-venv` if `python3 -m venv` lacks `ensurepip`.
- Use `argus doctor --advisor none --verify` for deterministic diagnostics.
  Use `argus doctor` when you want an installed Agent to inspect and repair
  Argus directly.
- Use `argus --config-help` to check the effective backend/model before blaming
  setup or authentication.
