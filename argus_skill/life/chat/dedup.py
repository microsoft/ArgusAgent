"""Delivery-guard helpers shared by the chat channels.

Feishu redelivers an event until the app acknowledges it, and a reconnecting
WebSocket can replay recent traffic, so an inbound handler that is not
idempotent will run the same ``/add`` twice. These are the three guards every
channel needs:

* :class:`EventDedup` — remember processed event ids for 24h.
* :func:`sender_allowed` — allowlist gate on the sender id.
* :func:`chat_lock` — serialize work per chat so two messages from the same
  operator can't interleave mid-command.
