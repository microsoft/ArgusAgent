"""Vertical selection for the auto-research loop.

The loop runs ONE of several *verticals*, selected by a single ``vertical``
field in ``research/PIPELINE_STATE.json``:

* ``"research"`` — the full eight-stage research-paper pipeline
  (research → ... → submission). This is the default and the safe fallback
  whenever intent is unclear: producing a paper subsumes the optimize work,
  so over-running is never a correctness hazard, only a cost one.
* ``"speedrun"`` — the lean numeric-optimization vertical (setup → optimize →
  measure → report). No literature review, no draft, no reviewer simulation,
  no submission packaging. Used when the objective is "make this number go the
  right way on this script" rather than "write me a paper". This is the
  nanochat-autoresearch / GPU-kernel-speedrun shape.

Two sides of the selector live here (the DECIDE side is no longer here — the
Manager AGENT chooses the vertical; see ``manager/_core.py`` ``decide_vertical``
and ``manager/domain_author.py``):

* the **read side** (``resolve_vertical``) is cheap, deterministic, and
  LLM-free. It reads the vertical the Manager already decided and persisted. It
  is FAIL-HARD: if nothing valid is resolvable it RAISES
  ``VerticalResolutionError`` rather than silently defaulting to ``"research"``.
* the **write side** (``persist_vertical``) writes the chosen vertical into the
  pipeline state and seeds ``current_stage`` to the vertical's first stage. It
  validates the name (``require_vertical``) and RAISES on an unknown vertical or
  a corrupt state file — no swallowed errors.

The resolved vertical has one authority: the Manager-persisted ``vertical`` in
``research/PIPELINE_STATE.json`` (including a Manager-authored data domain).

There are NO keyword classifiers and NO fallbacks: an objective is never mapped
to a vertical by matching words, and a missing/corrupt state is never quietly
coerced to ``"research"``. The Manager decides; the harness only validates,
persists, and reads back — loudly.

    """Reset ``current_stage`` to ``new_vertical``'s first stage when a
    genuinely NEW, operator-issued intent supersedes an already-finished prior
    run, whether the newly selected vertical is different or the same. A
    Manager-confirmed standing-objective replacement may pass
    ``force_replacement=True`` to reset immediately even when the old pipeline
    was still in progress; ordinary bounded/reclassification calls retain the
    conservative completed-run-only behavior.

    Call this AFTER ``persist_vertical(project_root, new_vertical)`` has
    already run, so the stage machinery (``current_stage`` /
    ``rollback_stage``) resolves against the NEW vertical. ``old_vertical``
    must be the vertical name that was persisted BEFORE that call (e.g. from
    ``resolve_vertical`` or a raw read taken prior to persisting), so this can
    compare against what came before.

    Rationale: ``persist_vertical`` is intentionally seed-only and never
    resets an existing ``current_stage`` — correct for in-project
    reclassification (e.g. research -> speedrun mid-project; see
    ``test_persist_vertical_never_resets_existing_stage``), where a
    stage name foreign to the new vertical is still real progress that must
    be preserved. But when the OLD vertical had already reached ITS OWN
    terminal stage with ``status="done"`` (fully completed on its own stage
    list) and a brand-new intent arrives, that terminal stage belongs to the
    closed-out prior run. This is true even when both intents resolve to the
    same vertical: leaving (for example) ``math/review=done`` or
    ``research/submission=done`` in place makes the Planner immediately declare
    the new task complete. For a different vertical, a same-named stage can
    similarly look like false progress. This function detects both cases and
    rolls the state back to the selected vertical's first stage via
    ``stage_machine.rollback_stage`` (audited, ``rolled_back_by="manager"``),
    without touching ``persist_vertical``'s own never-reset contract.

    Returns ``True`` iff a reset was actually applied. Without forced
    replacement, no-op (returns ``False``) when: there is no prior vertical,
    the prior vertical was not actually finished, or the rollback primitive rejects the target stage
    (e.g. the stale stage was never even a member of the new vertical's
    order, in which case ``current_stage()`` already falls back safely on its
    own). Fail-open: any error is treated as "nothing to reset" so a probe or
    rollback hiccup never blocks the Manager's division.
