"""The citation checker: what it can settle, what it cannot, and when it blocks.

Two layers with opposite failure modes, so they are tested for opposite things.
Existence is mechanical and its danger is over-claiming — a registry that
answers "yes" has said nothing about the proposition, and a registry that does
not answer has said nothing at all, so the tests below are mostly about the
answers this layer must *not* give. Attribution ends in a reader's word, and its
danger is the unexaminable verdict, so those tests are about the passage the
program insists on before it will record one.

The third thing covered here is when any of it blocks. The requirement is that
checking never interrupts the mathematics and always precedes delivery, which is
one assertion about ``solve`` and one about ``review``.
