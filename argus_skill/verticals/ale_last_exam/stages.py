"""Single-stage vertical for Agents' Last Exam's hardest workflows.

ALE evaluates a completed professional deliverable against a hidden reference
after the agent exits.  A multi-stage research or optimization pipeline is the
wrong shape: it spends the episode budget producing internal scaffolding while
the required workbook, model, simulation, report, video, or program remains
unfinished.  This vertical therefore has one ``execute`` stage.  The normal
Engineer/Reviewer round loop supplies iteration inside that stage.

The reviewer cannot access the hidden reference or run the final grader.  It
instead verifies every observable precondition that commonly causes a hard
zero: exact output paths, complete artifact bundles, parseability, native-tool
state, measured rather than guessed results, and evidence that long-running
jobs actually finished.
