"""Planning-cycle phase: waiting-verdict handling and project_done normalization.

Covers the planner's ``waiting`` branch (Manager-feedback-unresolved check,
open-ended wait reconciliation, plan-revision rollback, recorded waiting entry,
and the stall-breaker verification probe), followed by the full-paper-gate
override, the research-target completion gate, revision/project_done
rejection, open-ended vs. plain ``project_done`` handling, and the
degenerate no-new-tasks rejection. All of this runs after the planner has
returned a non-error verdict but before any backlog dedupe/enqueue.
