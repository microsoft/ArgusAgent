"""Manager stage-transition decision: prompt + strict parser.

The Manager is the SOLE authority over pipeline stage transitions. After the
reviewer (and planner) produce their structured feedback, the Manager
independently judges whether to ADVANCE to a later stage, HOLD on the current
one, or ROLL BACK to an earlier stage, then writes ``PIPELINE_STATE.json``. The prompt body lives in ``roles.prompts.manager`` and is re-exported here for
source compatibility; this module owns the strict parser for its JSON verdict.

Fail-closed everywhere: any ambiguity in the model's answer (bad JSON, unknown
action, an advance target that is not a later stage, a rollback
target that is not strictly earlier) parses to HOLD. The Manager therefore never
silently advances on a malformed verdict.

    whether the stage was simply not the last one, an external gate was open, a

    not certified. Testbed run 13 hit the first of those with the problem fully
