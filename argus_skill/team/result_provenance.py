"""Optional cryptographic provenance for a teammate's result file.

A teammate's banked metric is read from a JSON file (``ARGUS_TEAMMATE_RESULT_FILE``)
that lives inside the engineer's OWN, unsandboxed working directory. On its own the
harness therefore cannot tell a real official-eval number from one the engineer
typed — the "the scorer authored it" property is convention, not enforcement.

This module closes that hole when the operator opts in: the *isolated* scorer (the
eval server, which the engineer cannot enter or tamper with) SIGNS the result with
an Ed25519 private key the engineer never has, and the harness VERIFIES it with only
the public key. A forged or tampered result then fails verification and is not banked.

Design notes:

* **Vertical-blind.** The harness only knows "verify a signature if a verify key is
  configured". Which scorer signs, and the operator glue that carries the signature
  into the result file, are domain concerns — not baked in here.
* **Asymmetric on purpose.** An HMAC would force the verifier (which runs in the
  engineer's reach) to hold the secret, so the engineer could forge. With Ed25519
  the private key stays inside the scorer container; the harness needs only the
  public key, which is safe to expose.
* **Off by default.** Both sides are inert unless their env var is set, so nothing
  changes for a fleet that has not wired signing.

``cryptography`` is imported lazily so the base package keeps no hard crypto
dependency; it is only required once provenance is actually enabled.
