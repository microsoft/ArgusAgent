"""prose-vertical stage definitions.

The FOURTH literary vertical: literary/narrative prose (抒情/叙事散文/随笔/回忆, zh or
en), consuming the same four shared contracts. Machine layer is honestly thin
(prose_state structure + declared hard constraints); the craft — concrete
observation, keeping fact distinct from memory, real paragraph movement, an earned
ending — is live-reviewer.

Stages (``completion_gate="none"``):
1. **intake**: record ``prose/task_envelope.json`` + derive ``prose/prose_brief.json``.
2. **plan**: declare ``prose/prose_state.json`` (narrative_center / observation /
   factual_anchors / memory_boundary / paragraph_movement / ending_strategy).
3. **draft**: write ``prose/draft.md``.
4. **structure_check**: machine-check prose_state completeness + hard constraints
   -> ``prose/structure_report.json``.
5. **review**: reviewer emits ``prose/review.json`` (structure blocking + craft live).
6. **revise**: ``prose/final.md`` + ``prose/revision_plan.json`` + ``prose/artifact_manifest.json``.
