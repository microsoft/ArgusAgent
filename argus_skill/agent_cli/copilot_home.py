"""Give Argus's Copilot workers a home of their own.

The Copilot CLI keeps its whole working state — session transcripts, the
session-store database, logs — under ``COPILOT_HOME``, defaulting to
``~/.copilot``. That default is the operator's personal directory: the same one
their own ``copilot`` invocations and their editor use.

Argus runs many Copilot-backed roles concurrently and continuously, so with the
default every daemon, every mission, and every control-plane call writes there
too. On the host this was measured against, the operator's ``~/.copilot`` held
46,220 session directories and 47 GB, growing by ~115 sessions an hour, while
the Argus-owned home next to the rest of its state held 10. The operator's own
history is buried, and the growth lands on whichever filesystem ``$HOME`` is on
rather than the one chosen for Argus state.

Pointing the workers at ``<ARGUS_SKILL_HOME>/copilot-home`` fixes both. Recent
Copilot CLI releases also keep login tokens in ``config.json`` under that home,
so an empty or stale isolated home can make ordinary one-shot workers report
``No authentication information found`` while a warm ACP process using the
operator home still works. Preparation therefore mirrors only the small set of
authentication fields from the operator config; Argus-owned session state and
all unrelated config fields remain isolated.

An operator who sets ``COPILOT_HOME`` themselves is always obeyed — including
the private per-worktree home the self-maintenance sandbox sets up, which must
keep pointing at its own copy.
