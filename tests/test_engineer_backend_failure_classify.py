"""Engineer fatal-error classification: a dead Codex/Copilot subprocess is a
transient backend failure, so the engineer retries in a fresh session instead
of burning a full reviewer round on a no-output turn.

Regression for the gpt-5.5-on-fnyweg live run where the engineer's Codex
process intermittently exited 2 ("Process exited with code 2 before turn
completion.") and, because that string was not in the backend-failure pattern
list, every crash wasted a whole reviewer round (mission stalled in research).
