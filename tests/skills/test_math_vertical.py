    # Math stays light on machinery compared with kernel_engineering. The
    # modules below are the exception, and the reason is narrow: without a way
    # to measure the distance to the goal, "how hard was this step" silently
    # replaces "how much closer did this get us". `lean_evidence` is the same
    # kind of exception for formal proof — it reads what a compiler recorded so
    # a `sorry`, a stale pass, or a formalization of the wrong statement cannot
    # be presented as evidence. They measure; they do not add stages, roles, or
    # required paperwork, and a project with no `.lean` file never sees them.
    #
    # Two of them are not measures. `math_state` is the write path into the
    # research-math kernel, and it lives here rather than inside that package
    # for two reasons: it holds the repository's file lock, which the kernel may
    # not import without losing the property that lets it travel, and the rule
    # it enforces — that no agent-typed argument selects an evidence tier which
    # confers kernel status — is policy about this host's agents, which the
    # kernel is deliberately free of. `context_projection` is an adapter: it
    # reads that same state kernel and the claimed backlog item and renders what
    # *this* mission needs to know about the one claim it is about, and it lives
    # here because it is the only part that touches an Argus type
    # (`BacklogItem`), which that package's whole point is to do without.
    # Neither adds a stage or a required file: a project with no recorded claim
    # never loads either.
    #
    # `citation_check` is the third of that kind and the one that earns its
    # place least obviously, since a project can cite nothing and never load it.
    # It is here because the risk it addresses has no other checker: Lean can
    # certify that a theorem follows from its hypotheses and can say nothing
    # about whether the hypothesis imported as "Theorem 3.2 of [K]" is in [K],
    # and a fabricated reference is not a citation defect, it is a proof that
    # does not exist. It adds no stage and no required file — it derives its own
    # work list from the ledger — and blocks only at `review`.
    # `lean_async` is the one module here that is machinery rather than a
    # measure, and it is worth being uncomfortable about: starting a process and
    # asking later is a generic capability, and generic capabilities belong in
    # core. It is here because everything that makes it more than `Popen` is
    # policy that only this vertical holds — that a compiler answer is bound to
    # the digest of the source *and* of the statement fidelity document, that a
    # run whose text moved publishes nothing rather than something, and that a
    # worker which died is an environment failure and not a broken proof. Those
    # rules live in `lean_evidence`, and this is `verify` with the waiting taken
    # out, so a caller reaches it through the same CLI and gets the same records.
    # It is a separate module rather than more of `lean_evidence` for one
    # concrete reason: `lean_evidence` is imported by `stages.py` on every
    # completion check, and the completion gate has no business importing a
    # process launcher. It adds no stage and no required file, and nothing loads
    # it unless someone types `submit`.
