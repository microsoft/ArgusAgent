"""Read a role's decision out of ordinary prose, without dictating its shape.

Roles are not forced to emit JSON. A model told to reply with "ONE JSON object
and NOTHING else" spends its answer satisfying a serialiser instead of thinking,
loses the ability to explain itself, and fails the whole decision when it adds a
sentence of context. The harness is not smarter than the agent, and demanding a
wire format is the harness deciding how the agent may speak.

Instead the role writes naturally and states its decision on named lines, the
same convention the Planner has always used for ``PROJECT_DONE=`` /
``REASON=``. This module is that convention, generalised so every role decision
can use one reader.

The parsing is deliberately tolerant:

* ``KEY=value`` and ``KEY: value`` both work;
* a leading bullet or an ``ARGUS_`` prefix is ignored;
* surrounding backticks and code fences are stripped;
* the key is matched case-insensitively;
* anything that is not a recognised key is skipped, so prose above, below or
  between the lines costs nothing;
* the last occurrence wins, so a role that restates its conclusion at the end
  is read the way a human would read it.

JSON is still *accepted* where a caller opts in — an older session or a model
that volunteers a JSON object should not fail — but it is never required.
