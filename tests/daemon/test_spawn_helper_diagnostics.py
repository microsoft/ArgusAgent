"""The clean-launcher boundary must relay why a daemon refused to start.

Bug #40: the helper ran with ``quiet=True``, so every admission refusal in
``spawn_detached_process`` took its ``if not quiet`` branch to nowhere and
exited non-zero having written nothing. The caller found empty stderr and
raised the bare fallback, "clean daemon launcher exited with code 3". A
testbed re-run in a directory whose previous daemon was still alive therefore
started no executor at all, and the mission sat queued with no stated reason.

The guarantee is unchanged; the seam moved. The launcher now *returns* its exit
code rather than raising, because ``webapi.daemon_lifecycle`` branches on that
code — ``_retryable_windows_spawn_failure`` for the one transient Win32 retry,
and ``rc == 3`` for an admission refusal — and an exception routes past both.
So the refusal travels as data: the launcher records the helper's whole stderr
on ``config.last_spawn_error``, and ``_launcher_failure_message`` renders it for
the operator. These tests drive that pair the same way the caller does, so what
they pin is still the string an operator actually reads.
