# Project Venv Package Management

## TL;DR

Every project has its own `./.venv/` under the project root. **You may
freely install any package you need into it, at any stage, on any
round.** No approval, no committee. The only iron rule: it goes into
the project venv, never into the Argus framework venv.

```bash
# Always use the project venv's pip:
./.venv/bin/pip install <package>

# Always use the project venv's python:
./.venv/bin/python <script.py>
```

## When to use this skill

**Every stage. Every round.** Research, plan, benchmark, run, analysis,
draft, review, submission — if you hit any of the following, install
the missing package immediately:

- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '<x>'`
- `ImportError: cannot import name '<x>'`
- A README example for your chosen framework uses a package you don't
  have
- The shortlisted training/inference framework needs a CUDA / triton /
  flash-attention / xformers extension
- A benchmark loader needs an evaluator dependency (clip, fairseq,
  detector backbones, …)
- A figure script needs matplotlib / plotly / seaborn / cairosvg
- A new PDF / TeX / image tool is needed for draft or review

Do NOT:

- Apologize for needing to install something
- Open an issue / wait for the operator
- Switch to a worse approach to avoid the install
- Fall back to a stub / mock / oracle because "the package is missing"

## The two-rule contract

### Rule 1 — Use the project venv

The project venv is always at `<project-root>/.venv/`. Always use the
absolute paths from the project root:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python       # ← the project's Python interpreter
./.venv/bin/pip          # ← the project's pip
./.venv/bin/pytest       # ← installed via project venv if needed
./.venv/bin/accelerate   # ← installed via project venv if needed
```

If `which python` does not resolve to `<project>/.venv/bin/python`, you
are in the wrong shell context. Either `source .venv/bin/activate`
once, or prefix every command with `./.venv/bin/python` / `./.venv/bin/pip`.

### Rule 2 — Never touch the Argus framework venv

The Argus framework Python is at `${ARGUS_SKILL_PYTHON}` (the interpreter
shown in each round's runtime prompt). It runs the daemon, the
reviewer, the planner, and the helper CLIs. Installing
project dependencies there pollutes every other project that shares
this host. **Do not run**:

```bash
# ❌ FORBIDDEN
${ARGUS_SKILL_PYTHON} -m pip install <anything>
pip install <anything>          # if `pip` is the framework one on PATH
sudo pip install <anything>
```

Use `./.venv/bin/pip` instead. Always.

## The project venv is allowed to inherit host packages

The launcher creates the project venv with `--system-site-packages`,
so anything pre-installed at the host level (typically `torch` with
CUDA on an ML-ready host) is already visible from inside the project
venv. You do **not** need to reinstall torch / CUDA / triton in that
case. Verify with:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

If torch is missing entirely (non-ML host), install it into the project
venv. If torch is present but broken, install a fresh wheel into the
overlay; pip will shadow the host copy with the project copy.

## Versioned-overlay tactic for broken host packages

When the host site-packages has a broken / outdated copy of a package
you also need (this happened in v2 with `accelerate`), install a
fresh wheel into the project venv — overlay wins:

```bash
./.venv/bin/pip install --upgrade accelerate
./.venv/bin/python -c "import accelerate; print(accelerate.__version__, accelerate.hooks)"
```

## Record what you installed

After each batch of `pip install`, run:

```bash
./.venv/bin/pip freeze > experiments/PIP_FREEZE.txt
```

so future rounds (and the reviewer) can see the exact dependency
snapshot. This is much cheaper than wondering "why does it work
locally but break in the subagent" later.

## Reviewer hook

If the round summary says "skipped because dependency missing", or the
engineer produced a stub function because `import X` failed, the
reviewer must `continue` and explicitly tell the engineer:

> Install `<package>` into the project venv with
> `./.venv/bin/pip install <package>` and retry; do not fall back to
> stubs.

A reply of "I noticed `<package>` was missing so I worked around it" is
never acceptable. The work-around is the install.
