"""Loop 12: the capability matrix is honest and checkable — final acceptance.

Asserts every A/B capability points at a test file that actually exists, that no
live-model / gap concept is smuggled into tier A (the anti-fake-green invariant),
that the gaps are documented, and that all five verticals + the shared layer are
covered. The full regression (run separately) proves the referenced tests pass.
