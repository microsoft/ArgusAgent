"""Prompt rewrite — restate an operator's short draft BEFORE it is dispatched.

Operators type terse requests ("优化一下 kernel", "写个 paper", "fix the flaky
test"). Feeding that verbatim to the Planner/Engineer/Reviewer team burns rounds
on guessing what was meant. The Manager already owns front-door judgment, so it
is the right role to restate the request as an executable brief.

This module is deliberately thin and mirrors :mod:`argus_skill.manager.plan_mode`:

* :class:`PromptRewrite` — the in-memory result shape.
* :func:`rewrite_prompt` — ask the model (via the runner the cockpit already
  holds) for a rewrite and parse it. Failures are surfaced explicitly via
  ``PromptRewrite.error``; we never silently hand back a fabricated rewrite.
* :func:`parse_rewrite_text` — the pure, unit-testable parser (no live model).

Design note (matches the rest of the Manager): the harness makes no judgment
about whether a rewrite is *good*. It renders a request, parses the reply
robustly, and hands the result to the operator to accept, edit, or discard. The
rewrite is never auto-sent — the operator always sees it first.

    ``questions`` is what the Manager deliberately kept OUT of the rewrite and
    is putting to the operator instead: both things it could not infer and
    things it is actively proposing (a metric, a threshold, a scope limit) but
    will not decide on their behalf. The Manager is expected to bring this kind
    of judgment — it just may not smuggle it into ``rewritten``.
