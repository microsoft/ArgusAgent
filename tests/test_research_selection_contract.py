"""Tests for the research 'what we promised at selection' block.

The block is PURE VISIBILITY (no verdict): it re-surfaces what the campaign
itself wrote into ``research/IDEA_SELECTION.json`` before the work began, so a
role reading a result can see it next to the promise. It must never decide
whether the baseline was strong or the margin was cleared.

The file is Agent-authored, so its shape differs every campaign. These tests
pin the intent-matching (nested, differently-named), the visible record of
promises never filed, and the fail-soft contract.
