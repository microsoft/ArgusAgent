"""Architecture invariants, in executable form.

Argus is a domain-agnostic runtime: four persistent roles, and verticals as
duck-typed providers that supply domain knowledge without acquiring authority.
Most of that contract currently lives in prose and in the reading habits of
whoever last touched the code, which means it can only be violated silently.

These tests make the load-bearing parts of the boundary fail out loud. What is
pinned here is deliberately the *shape* of each seam, not the behaviour behind
it, so ordinary refactoring stays green and only a genuine boundary change goes
red. Every test below names the property it protects and says, in its
docstring, what breaks in production when that property stops holding.
