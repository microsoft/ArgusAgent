"""The Project's goal contract: what was asked for, and what may change it.

North-Star review §4.1/§4.2/§5.2. The pieces of a goal contract already existed
— ``mission.json`` carries the objective, the acceptance check and non-goals,
campaign identity hashes the objective, and ``VerticalDecision`` carries the
target level and venue — but they were fragments with no single type and no
rule about who may rewrite which part.

The distinction this module adds is between two kinds of clause:

``precise``
    A constraint that can be checked mechanically and that the operator
    actually chose: a target number, a hardware budget, a named baseline, a
    deadline. Changing one changes what "done" means, so the Manager may
    propose it but not commit it alone (operator decision §9.3).

``semantic``
    A description of intent that a Reviewer judges: "the write-up should be
    readable by a systems engineer", "prefer approaches that generalise". The
    Manager clarifies these autonomously — that is the job, and requiring a
    human for every rewording would make the contract read-only in practice.

Why the split is enforced here rather than by asking the model nicely: a Manager
that quietly relaxes a precise constraint it cannot meet produces a project that
reports success against a goal nobody agreed to. That is the one failure mode a
contract exists to prevent, and it is mechanical enough for the harness to own
without judging any research.

Deliberate non-goal: this module does not decide whether a project is finished.
Completion lives in :mod:`argus_skill.core.project_api`, and existing projects
are exempt from contract-based completion (operator decision §9.6). Writing a
contract is additive today — it records what the Manager committed to and
disciplines later edits.
