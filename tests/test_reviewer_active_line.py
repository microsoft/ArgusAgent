    Verticals hand the Reviewer commands that write: math's review skill tells
    it to file `math_state judge` and `citation_check attribute`, and those
    records are the independent-review evidence channel — the one thing only a
    Reviewer can supply. A model holding both instructions has to pick one, and
    the read-only sentence is the categorical one, so the channel starves
    silently and the gate that waits on it never sees a check that was never
    filed. The rule is about the *work under review*, so it now says that.
