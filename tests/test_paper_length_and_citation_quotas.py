"""Paper length and reference count are proxies, not standards.

Two arithmetic gates used to reject complete work: a 35-entry / 30-key
bibliography floor, and a rule that the Conclusion must not start before the
second-to-last page. Both punished short, complete papers and rewarded padding.
The venue page count is a *ceiling*; citation sufficiency is proportional to
what the paper claims. What must still fail is fabrication, over-length, and
wrong templates.
