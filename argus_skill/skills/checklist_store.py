"""Read legacy per-project checklist overrides.

Current Planner verdicts no longer carry or apply ``checklist_ops``. This module
keeps the read path for projects that already have
``<project_root>/research/CHECKLISTS.json`` and re-injects each vertical's
protected floor against direct or historical edits.

The file is bound to one explicit ``vertical``. A store authored for research
is ignored after the Manager changes the project to math (and vice versa); stage
names or gates never leak across verticals.

Read path: :func:`store_items_for_stage` is consulted by
``stage_machine.format_stage_checklist`` / ``format_full_pipeline_checklist``
BEFORE the seed constants. It returns:

* a tuple of items when the store vertical matches the committed project
  vertical and has an entry for the stage — used as the checklist base;
* ``()`` when the historical stage key is present but its effective list is
  empty;
* ``None`` when the stage is absent from the store — the signal to FALL BACK to
  the seed constant. This ``None`` is what preserves byte-identical rendering for
  research/quant/speedrun when no project checklist exists.

A missing/corrupt store reads as empty. ``ChecklistItem`` and the
active-vertical seed lookup are late-imported to avoid the module-load cycle
``stage_machine`` ↔ this module.
