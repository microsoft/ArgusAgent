#: Names from this repository's own verification surface.
#:
#: A mission's success verdict is evidence about the work. It is not evidence
#: about a procedure that operated on the machinery which computed the verdict,
#: because that procedure's only witness is the thing it altered. Run 13 is the
#: worked example: an Engineer blocked at a goal gate called
#: ``complete_final_stage`` directly, the forced completion made the mission
#: read as success, and the post-mission reviewer -- correctly following its
#: instruction that a done verdict is verified evidence -- promoted the
#: technique into the cross-project profile library, where every future
#: Engineer in every future project would have loaded it. The candidate it
#: promoted said, in as many words, "before calling ``complete_final_stage``,
#: ensure ``.argus/PIPELINE_STATE.json`` in the project state root has a
#: resolved math objective mode".
#:
#: So a candidate naming any of these is withheld from the evidence bundle
#: rather than argued about, and anything reaching the shared library that
#: names one is quarantined afterwards. Both, because the reviewer can write
#: such a skill from the mission result alone without ever seeing a candidate.
#:
#: This is a text filter and text filters are evadable: a paraphrase that never
#: names a symbol passes. It is worth having anyway -- the run-13 candidate did
#: not paraphrase, because nothing was hiding. An agent that repairs a gate and
#: writes down how believes it did the right thing, and says so plainly. What
#: this stops is the honest version travelling silently to every later project.
#: The evadable version is the host-side receipt problem, which is a different
#: and larger piece of work.
