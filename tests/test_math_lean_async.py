"""Compiling Lean without holding the mathematician still.

``verify`` blocks its caller for the whole compile. Measured on this host with a
stub compiler, a six-second compile plus a six-second axiom audit costs the
caller twelve seconds of doing nothing; with Mathlib it is minutes of a
reasoning agent sitting idle. ``submit``/``reclaim`` is the same step with the
waiting removed.

Everything here is adversarial about one thing: an asynchronous run has a much
wider window in which the source can move under it than a synchronous one, and
the guarantee ``verify`` just closed — a run whose inputs did not hold still
publishes nothing at all — has to survive that widening rather than be quietly
weakened by it. So the tests below check both halves of how that is done: the
compile reads a snapshot taken at submit, and publication still checks the live
files.

The other distinction under test is the one the whole vertical rests on. A
background process that died wrote no verdict, and "the run was lost" must never
reach a reader as "the proof was rejected".

The compiler is stubbed with a small executable rather than timed against a real
one: a test that depends on beating a real Lean is a test that passes on a slow
host and says nothing on a fast one. Where a test needs a compile to still be
running, it gates the stub on a file rather than on a sleep, so the state under
test is chosen rather than raced for.
